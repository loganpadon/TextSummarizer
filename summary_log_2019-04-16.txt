Summarization comparison for article: Making family: the journey into exile of a South Sudan refugee - part 2 #LSEreturn
Similarity: 0.3253012048192771
Abstract: Through the story of Chol, LSE’s Naomi Pendle explores the meaning of exile and the lived experience of being a refugee through cycles of displacement and return. In the first article of this two-part series, Pendle tells us how Chol rebuilt home after years spent in exile. Now, LSE’s Naomi Pendle narrates Chol’s return into exile, a journey that was in itself a return and cemented his ability to build a family
Automatic summary: Now, LSE’s Naomi Pendle narrates Chol’s return into exile, a journey that was in itself a return and cemented his ability to build a family. It was these networks, as much as a journey to a safe space, that he sought to cement as safety for himself, his wife and his son. Yet, they knew that the journey would be fraught with dangers and force them to weave between government and rebel held territories.

Summarization comparison for article: Young people are highly critical of Brexit and fear the insularity it could bring
Similarity: 0.13559322033898305
Abstract: Most young people did not support Brexit and the referendum result left many feeling frustrated and disempowered, write Shakuntala Banaji and Sam Mejias (LSE). They fear the vote will make the UK more insular and are highly critical of the way the campaign was conducted. In focus groups, they showed a strong understanding of the EU – and want a Brexit settlement that tackles inequality as well as ensuring Britain is an open and welcoming country
Automatic summary: A minority of respondents asserted that the referendum and subsequent events had been a ‘participation catalyst’ for young people to become more politically active. As soon as people voted leave, there were attacks on minorities…I don’t know [if] people thought it was more OK to be racist, because they were leaving [the EU]. Secondly, young people expressed dissatisfaction that the oldest generations (65+) should have such a disproportionate influence on the futures of the youngest citizens.

Summarization comparison for article: What precisely does 'Canada +++' mean?
Similarity: 0.4027777777777778
Abstract: The Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, has described his plans for a future trading arrangement with the EU as 'Canada plus plus plus'. But what precisely does this expression mean, if anything, and what are the trade and political implications? Andrew Blick (KCL and the Federal Trust) explains

Summarization comparison for article: The political significance of Poland's government reshuffle
Similarity: 0.1111111111111111
Abstract: A sweeping reshuffle by Poland's new prime minister has changed the shape and direction of its government, with a greater emphasis being placed on economic modernisation, political stabilisation and improving EU relations. But as Aleks Szczerbiak writes, this pivot to the technocratic centre risks alienating the ruling party's core electorate, and is more about packaging the government's reforms attractively than abandoning its its radical state re-construction programme
Automatic summary: Most Law and Justice deputies support this, but in autumn 2016 large protests forced the ruling party to vote down a previous attempt to introduce greater restrictions. Cardiologist and deputy higher education minister Łukasz Szumowski took over as health minister from Konstanty Radziwiłł, who failed to resolve a high profile dispute involving resident doctors.

Summarization comparison for article: What the 2015 Greek debt negotiations tell us about Germany's negotiating stance on Brexit
Similarity: 0.16161616161616163
Abstract: If the UK wants to secure favourable terms during the Brexit negotiations, it will be crucial to win the support of Germany. But what are the key German priorities as the talks move on to the second phase? Luuk Molthof writes that the 2015 Greek debt negotiations offer some insights into the German approach, and that the UK is likely to be disappointed if it believes Germany will put economic interests above its political support for European integration
Automatic summary: To understand why the British government would do well to heed these warnings, it is useful to be reminded of Germany’s role in the 2015 Greek bailout negotiations. The reason why Germany ultimately agreed to another bailout was because a Greek exit from the eurozone would undermine the euro’s credibility as an instrument of political integration. Yet in order to protect the euro’s role as a political instrument, Germany was willing to bear the economic costs.

Abstract: Will the Overseas Electors Bill, proposing to give Britons living abroad the right to vote in UK elections for life, make it beyond second reading? Sue Collard puts recent developments in their wider context and explains their potential implications. She argues that if government does indeed mean business, then the issue is far too important to those affected to justify it being eventually sacrified to party politics

Summarization comparison for article: Quantity does matter as citation impact increases with productivity
Similarity: 0.1652892561983471
Abstract: Many scholars are encouraged to focus on the quality not the quantity of their publications, the rationale being that becoming too focused on productivity risks reducing the quality of one's work. But is this, in fact, the case? Peter van den Besselaar and Ulf Sandström have studied a large sample of researchers and found that, while results vary by field, there is a positive and stronger than linear relationship between productivity and quality (in terms of the top cited papers). This same pattern appears to apply to institutions as well as individual researchers
Automatic summary: Figure 3: Relationship between number of papers per university and impact in terms of Top10% papers. For each researcher we calculated the (field-normalised and fractionally counted) total number of publications and also the number of those publications that figure in the (2.5%) highest cited papers. In the social sciences, the (slightly) “diminishing returns” pattern seems to dominate; whereas the “impact ceiling” pattern was found for computer science & mathematics and for the humanities. Higher numbers of papers do result in even higher numbers of top cited papers.

Summarization comparison for article: Far right politics in Germany: from fascism to populism?
Similarity: 0.1650485436893204
Abstract: The rise of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) was one of the major stories of the 2017 German elections. As Tomá\v Nociar and Jan Philipp Thomeczek write, there has been a tendency among some commentators to draw parallels between the AfD and extremist or fascist parties from Germany's past. They argue that this is both unhelpful and inaccurate, and that the AfD has far more in common with other ‘populist’ parties who have had success in recent European elections
Automatic summary: LSE European Politics and Policy (EUROPP) Blog: Far right politics in Germany: From fascism to populism? This new type of populist radical right party either never developed or dropped the antidemocratic sentiment in favour of a populist critique of the establishment. It is the rise of a populist radical right that is successful precisely because of its populism and not because it embodies fascism or extremism.

Summarization comparison for article: Who is helped by Help to Buy?
Similarity: 0.12631578947368421
Abstract: What's not to like about a policy which can expand home ownership and boost the supply of housing? Geoff Meeks and J.Gay Meeks recount some of the doubts about the efficacy of the government's Help to Buy scheme. They present new evidence on some of its regressive distributional consequences, and touch on the opportunity cost of the subsidy programme
Automatic summary: These are “equity loans”, which means the government’s stake in a participating house changes at the same rate with the value of the house. As house prices rise, the argument goes, the government achieves capital gains, which offset the interest costs of servicing the debt which funds H2B. So the new house will be much the better buy, and it will be worth her while to pay more for the new than for the second- hand house.

Summarization comparison for article: El Salvador's experience of UN peacebuilding reveals the ineffectiveness of 'development as usual' approaches
Similarity: 0.10714285714285714
Abstract: To provide the vital "peace dividend" of better lives and livelihoods, peacebuilding must promote conflict-sensitive policies even where they are economically second-best. The UN can support this process by helping states in transition to reactivate their economies in an inclusive and sustainable manner, writes Graciana del Castillo (City University of New York)
Automatic summary: And even those that achieved a tenuous peace ended up highly aid dependent, often even for basic food needs. Lacking support, former combatants had to abandon programmes like arms-for-land that had given them a stake, however small, in the peace process.

Summarization comparison for article: Engaging with Parliament: what is good Select Committee evidence?
Similarity: 0.13414634146341464
Abstract: One way of trying to make an impact with one's research is to use it to provide evidence and information to one of Parliament's Select Committees. Victoria Honour offers some insight into how these committees and their inquiries work, and how academics can engage with them; including practical advice on how to structure and present written evidence, and information on what academic training and further resources are available
Automatic summary: Often the written evidence submission helps direct the focus of the oral evidence sessions, so do submit written evidence. All current and past inquiries, their accepted written evidence, oral evidence transcripts and videos (if filmed), and final reports are available on the parliamentary website as a public record.

Summarization comparison for article: We don't know how democracies die
Similarity: 0.16279069767441862
Abstract: Since the election of Donald Trump, many have expressed their concern that the United States could slip into an authoritarian backslide. Emily Holland and Hadas Aron react to this claim, most notably asserted in Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt's new book, 'How Democracies Die,' noting that the decline of one of the most stable, long-lasting democracies in the world can only be compared to the decline of other lasting, consolidated democracies, of which there are none
Automatic summary: The countries that are most vulnerable to populist democratic decline are simply those that are most vulnerable to democratic decline in general. Here lies the great danger of the populist turn: the battleground is vulnerable democracies, and the United States is consciously neglecting its role as a defender of democracy.

Summarization comparison for article: The hidden costs of research assessment exercises: the curious case of Australia
Similarity: 0.38095238095238093
Abstract: Research assessment exercises provide the government and wider public with assurance of the quality of university research, with the guiding principles being accountability, transparency, and openness. But is there the same accountability and openness when it comes to the public cost of these large-scale exercises? Ksenia Sawczak examines the situation in Australia as the research sector looks ahead to the new Engagement and Impact Assessment later this year. There seems little doubt this exercise will demand significant resources, with no guarantee it will achieve its stated goal of improving how universities engage with industry. Until the hidden costs of assessment exercises are revealed and a thorough consideration of their general utility is undertaken, questions will remain as to whether they are a responsible use of public monies
Automatic summary: There seems little doubt this exercise will demand significant resources, with no guarantee it will achieve its stated goal of improving how universities engage with industry. What is curious about Australia is that ERA functions in a vacuum, conducted by government but playing no role in informing federal research policy or funding allocations to universities. The authors of the NISA boldly stated that an exercise of this kind will ultimately lead to improvements in how universities engage with industry. Ksenia Sawczak examines the situation in Australia as the research sector looks ahead to the new Engagement and Impact Assessment later this year. About the author Ksenia Sawczak is Director of Research Services at the University of Canberra, where she oversees the preparation of data submissions to government agencies.

Summarization comparison for article: Looming REF deadlines lead to a rush in publication of lower quality research
Similarity: 0.2755905511811024
Abstract: The increased significance of research assessments and their implications for funding and career prospects has had a knock-on effect on academic publication patterns. Moqi Groen-Xu, Pedro A. Teixeira, Thomas Voigt and Bernhard Knapp report on research that reveals a marked increase in research productivity immediately prior to an evaluation deadline, which quickly reverses once the deadline has passed. Moreoever, the quality of papers published just before deadlines is lower, as measured by citations. Those who design research assessments should consider having cycles of varying lengths across different fields, affording researchers the time and opportunity to pursue more novel, risky projects
Automatic summary: Our research indicates that research output does indeed change around the time researchers are submitted to assessment exercises. Those who design research assessments should consider having cycles of varying lengths across different fields, affording researchers the time and opportunity to pursue more novel, risky projects. After our research was reported on the Times Higher Education, Steven Hill – Head of Research Policy at HEFCE – raised concerns about our interpretation of the findings. Because older papers had more time to accumulate citations, information about them is more precise at that time, thus biasing the choice of older articles with higher citation counts.

Abstract: When Britain leaves the EU in March 2019, will it become isolated and not influential, to paraphrase Sir John Major's words from his speech last week? In this blog, Monica Horten (LSE) investigates the Transition chapter of the EU Withdrawal Agreement and scrutinises how far Britain's influence could be written out from the very start
Automatic summary: Being involved in the expert groups and the committees, and the working groups is an essential element of influencing Brussels policy and staying in the know. British representatives will be shut out of Commission expert groups that discuss policy issues across the board from copyright and banking to food standards and fake news.

Summarization comparison for article: The UK government is shedding some of its illusions about Brexit, and softening its position
Similarity: 0.13333333333333333
Abstract: Step by step, the UK government is shedding some of its illusions about Brexit, argues Holger Schmieding (Berenberg). The United Kingdom has already accepted that it will have to meet the legally binding financial commitments it incurred while it was a member of the European Union (the so-called Brexit bill) and is going along with the EU's timetable for negotiations (divorce issues first, transition deal next, outlines of a future trade deal last). Last Friday saw another set of concessions being made by the Prime Minister
Automatic summary: Under such a deal, the UK would maintain access to the EU’s single market for goods and for some services on almost the same preferential terms as before. The only practical way in which Brexit could be reversed would be if early new elections swept a Labour-led government to power that might possibly call a new referendum. However, Theresa May is not yet close to such a deal that would minimise the economic damage to the UK.

Abstract: The recent surge in US protectionism constitutes a serious challenge to the global trade regime. The EU and China are likely to retaliate against American tariffs of 25 on steel imports and 10 on imported aluminium. The implications of the looming global trade war for Brexit Britain are severe, warns Robert Basedow (LSE)
Automatic summary: The rules-based global trade regime, which constituted an anchor of stability for the world economy since the end of World War II, would cease to exist. The looming WTO case has the potential to do significant long-term damage to the global trade regime and world economy. The risk of tariff retaliations spiralling out of control The surge in US protectionism constitutes a serious challenge to the global trade regime.

Summarization comparison for article: The spectre of automation? Three strategies to ensure automation works for the common good
Similarity: 0.38461538461538464
Abstract: Could the consequences of automation lead to the growth of communism, as Mark Carney has warned? Mathew Lawrence writes that deep technological change opens up two divergent paths: one where technologies are managed and owned to our collective advancement against one where they deepen inequalities. He draws on IPPR research to outline three strategies that will ensure automation works for the common good
Automatic summary: Managed well, automation could build a future of shared economic plenty, the productivity gains of technological change allowing us all to live better and more freely. Mathew Lawrence writes that deep technological change opens up two divergent paths: one where technologies are managed and owned to our collective advancement against one where they deepen inequalities. To address this, the more rapid adoption of digital technologies, including automation, should become one of the national ‘missions’ of the government’s industrial strategy.

Summarization comparison for article: Will Polish nationals feel at home in Scotland after Brexit?
Similarity: 0.21008403361344538
Abstract: How does it feel to be a Polish national in Scotland after the EU referendum? Kate Botterill (Edinburgh Napier University) discusses how the result and subsequent uncertainty affected them, and the strategies they have adopted to deal with it. Post-Brexit, the Scottish Government want a different approach to migration from the rest of the UK, which may lead to stronger identification with Scotland among many Poles living in the country. Nonetheless, Scottish public attitudes towards migration appear to be hardening
Automatic summary: So even though so many people voted to remain, I’m looking at the streets and I feel anger and I feel hatred… And I have an accent. Given these challenges, will changing Scotland’s narrative on migration be enough to make EU citizens feel at home? This research raises key questions about how Polish nationals are negotiating belonging in Scotland through broader affiliations with Europe, and often away from Poland. When it comes to migration, Scotland is widely considered to be on a different political journey to the rest of the UK.

Summarization comparison for article: The crisis in social care is connected to the gendered inadequacy of labour law
Similarity: 0.1414141414141414
Abstract: Lydia Hayes writes that social care is a feminist issue. Highlighting some of the appalling conditions that care workers tolerate, she explains how employment law fails to protect women's employment and to value feminised labour. She concludes that unless social care provision is revolutionised, women will have little choice but to serve as unpaid carers: stuck at home, excluded from public life, and denied life choices
Automatic summary: Until the wages of care workers are free from sexist devaluation, and until the work of care workers is fully recognised, the labour of all women is devalued. The inadequacy of minimum wage law The financial crisis of 2007/2008 heralded UK labour market changes in which care work became the largest source of low-waged work for women. Care workers are failed by the current right to a minimum wage where their work is not recognised as ‘work’ for the purposes of statutory pay protection.

Summarization comparison for article: High prices, not waste or over-use, drive high health care costs in the US
Similarity: 0.3
Abstract: The US spends nearly 18 percent of its GDP on health care, making it a real outlier among high-income countries in this area. But what is behind this unusually high level of health care spending? Irene Papanicolas investigates common beliefs about why spending is so high, including that US residents use more health care services, have poorer quality of care, and use 'too much' inpatient care. She finds that higher costs in the US are largely driven by higher prices across a wide range of health care services such as surgical procedures and drugs, as well as administrative complexity and costs
Automatic summary: The data suggest two main factors drive health care spending in the US: higher prices across a wide range of health care services and administrative complexity and costs. Evidence: The US has among the lowest proportion of health care spending on inpatient services (19 percent) and among the highest for outpatient services (42 percent). While low social spending may contribute to poorer population health outcomes, it is unlikely a primary driver of higher health care spending. Belief 1: The US spends more than other countries because US residents consume much more health care services.

Summarization comparison for article: How we can preserve assisted housing in the context of gentrification and constrained federal resources
Similarity: 0.34065934065934067
Abstract: Like many American cities, Washington DC is experiencing a squeeze in its affordable housing: population increases and declining stocks of government subsidized housing are making it harder for low-income households to find somewhere to live. In new research, Kathryn Howell looks at how existing assisted housing in Washington, DC is being preserved in the face of gentrification and funding challenges. She writes that preservation is a long and complex process that engages diverse stakeholders from tenants and tenant organizers to local and federal agency staff
Automatic summary: This case offers powerful support for increased collaboration between stakeholders and meaningful local laws and flexible funding for the preservation of affordable housing. But developing new funding sources and programs for the complex process of preservation requires multiple private and government stakeholders, shared governance and access to data. She writes that preservation is a long and complex process that engages diverse stakeholders from tenants and tenant organizers to local and federal agency staff.

This is an impressive analysis that uses internment as a prism to examine the War’s extra-European theatres, underscoring the conflict’s global dimensions and critically examining imperial notions of race, writes Joshua Smeltzer
Automatic summary: Indeed, Murphy’s narrative firmly establishes an interconnected web of camps, implicated in imperial notions of race and shaped by a common European civilising mission. At the outbreak of World War One, the British swiftly repatriated Germans from Cameroon and Togo, while transferring combatants and males of military age to camps in Britain.

Summarization comparison for article: Book review: a lab of one's own: science and suffrage in the First World War by Patricia Fara
Similarity: 0.11764705882352941
Abstract: In A Lab of One's Own: Science and Suffrage in the First World War, Patricia Fara follows the trajectories of women scientists during World War One, describing their struggles in academia and laboratories in tandem with the battle for the vote and the war unfolding across various fronts. Cléo Chassonnery-Zaïgouche praises the book for its complex and nuanced account of the changing status of women scientists in the early twentieth century
Automatic summary: Networks of women play a central role in the history of women’s education and work, from suffrage to upper-middle-class women’s philanthropic connections. First, Fara gives us some hints of changing views on women, but does not discuss the development of knowledge produced by women in the social sciences.

Summarization comparison for article: How is Oxfam being held accountable over the Haiti scandal?
Similarity: 0.13580246913580246
Abstract: The recent allegations against Oxfam employees in Haiti sparked a series of reports about misconduct within major charities, which in turn raised serious questions about accountability in the NGO sector. Domenico Carolei looks at whether the systems of accountability that apply to British NGOs and charities working in poor countries are adequate and comprehensive
Automatic summary: Intra-organisational accountability An internal dimension of the accountability process takes place at the organisational level among staff involved in the charity’s governance and administration. Institutional watchdogs and regulatory bodies may exercise a significant degree of accountability over charities by granting or revoking charity status, and by issuing disciplinary sanctions in cases of misconduct.

Summarization comparison for article: A coercive policy-making state? How the EU is alienating its citizens
Similarity: 0.37037037037037035
Abstract: The remit of EU institutions has expanded inexorably, writes Jeremy Richardson, all while their policy-making style has shifted from a consensus-based process towards a more coercive, top-down one. At the same time, the EU's focus on interest groups might have also exacerbated the problem of the democratic deficit by distancing the EU from broader public opinion. These realities have contributed to both Brexit and the broader 'populist revolt' across Member States
Automatic summary: At the same time, the EU’s focus on interest groups might have also exacerbated the problem of the democratic deficit by distancing the EU from broader public opinion. The shift in focus from the national to the EU level by interest groups might have exacerbated the problem of the democratic deficit. Many groups, such as women’s and environmental groups concluded that they would gain more policy concessions at the European level.

Summarization comparison for article: Assam against itself: a reply to Sanjib Baruah
Similarity: 0.11320754716981132
Abstract: In response to Professor Sanjib Baruah's article 'Stateless in Assam' which discussed a new focus on detention camps for 'stateless citizens', Suraj Gogoi, Gorky Chakraborty and Parag Jyoti Saikia reflect on the implications of reducing people to 'bare life'
Automatic summary: It has thus created a ‘state of exception’ in a space which itself is a ‘state of exception’ to the Indian state.

Summarization comparison for article: How will Brexit affect the social security rights of EU migrants in the UK, and how the social protection of EU staff?
Similarity: 0.0945945945945946
Abstract: Linda Hantrais focuses on two ways in which social security provisions may be affected by Brexit: the social security rights of EU migrants to the UK, where EU institutions have come to play an important coordinating role; and, the social protection rights of British officials working for EU institutions, where benefits and employers' contributions are paid from the EU administrative budget to which the UK contributes
Automatic summary: In the European Pillar of Social Rights, Juncker set out his strategy for achieving ‘upward convergence’ between EU Member States with ‘social protection as a productive factor’.

Summarization comparison for article: Critical actors and abortion law: a group of individuals in Northern Irish politics obstructs change
Similarity: 0.23711340206185566
Abstract: There are various reasons why progress on legal abortion in Northern Ireland has been blocked over the years. Key among them is that individual politicians rule out any suggestion of change, writes Jennifer Thomson. She argues that more attention should be given to the actions of individual actors, considering their role can often be as important as that of political parties or institutions
Automatic summary: Feminist political scientists have long employed the concept of ‘critical actors’ to refer to key individuals who instigate positive change within political institutions. Attempts to change abortion policy at the moment are also not helped by the fact that Northern Ireland is facing one of its most challenging political periods in decades. When considering why some policies are difficult to change, or even to implement at all, consideration must be given to the actions of individual members of political institutions.

Summarization comparison for article: The origins of city centrism: 'the potential of Glasgow city centre'
Similarity: 0.125
Abstract: Andy Pike analyses some of the themes in the 1983 report 'The Potential of Glasgow City Centre', an early example of city centrism with a policy repertoire that has since influenced urban and regional development thinking. He explains why, 35 years on, city centrism presents more of a mixed picture than a panacea for urban policy; in a separate post he offers thoughts on the way forward
Automatic summary: City policies – such as spatial planning, city centre regeneration, investment attraction, innovation, and skills – have supported structural evolution towards services. A central city focus upon the needs and dynamism of the urban core as the “natural location” for most business and many consumer services.

Summarization comparison for article: The limits of city centrism? We need to rethink how we approach urban and regional development
Similarity: 0.13253012048192772
Abstract: Following on from his previous analysis on why city centrism has not turned out to be a panacea for urban development so far, Andy Pike argues it is time for fresh thinking. He explains why we need to find better ways to think about and design policies that support the combination of the dynamism of Britain's city centres
Automatic summary: High skilled employment and agglomeration are necessary but not sufficient for city growth On city skills, city growth and high-skilled occupations are closely related. But the city centrism propositions of ‘smart cities becoming smarter’, and a positive relationship between agglomeration and high skilled employment growth do not appear to apply to British cities.

Summarization comparison for article: The grass is greener when there is education: an experience from Balochistan
Similarity: 0.17647058823529413
Abstract: Literacy and socio-economic indicators of Balochistan province in Pakistan are a grave reminder of the state of poverty in the region. Asmat Kakar draws from his personal experience of growing up in the region and writes that only education can level the playing field and provide socio-economic development
Automatic summary: According to the Ministry of Education report Pakistan Education Statistics 2015-16, Balochistan is on top of the list, with an alarming 70 per cent children out of school. It states that more than 70 per cent and around 85 per cent people in rural areas of Balochistan province are living in multidimensional poverty.

Summarization comparison for article: In Congressional races, political networks play an important role in ensuring minority representation
Similarity: 0.12408759124087591
Abstract: A number of retirements in Congress ahead of the 2018 midterms have opened up the possibility for increased Latino representation in the US House of Representatives. But, the past has shown that Latino candidates aren't always selected for, or win elections in, majority Latino districts and that Latinos and non-Latinos who are elected don't always represent the views of their constituents. In new research, Angela X. Ocampo finds that political networks have a large influence on whether a Latino or non-Latino gets onto the ballot as a candidate. These networks are also often able to push candidates forward based on their legislative priorities, which may or may not align with the preferences of their constituents
Automatic summary: This article is based on the paper The Wielding Influence of Political Networks: Representation in Majority- Latino Districts in Political Research Quarterly (PRQ). Lastly, the evidence showed that lack of coordination and fragmentation among existent political networks paved the way for the emergence of non-Latino candidates in majority-Latino districts. Political networks were also critical in narrowing down candidate fields when announced Latino and non-Latino candidates might weaken the chances of one another. The dataset included vote turns, candidate and district demographics and financial contributions made by the candidates themselves, individuals, parties and groups.

Summarization comparison for article: The rhetorical attacks against the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School illustrate the breakdown of civil discourse in US politics
Similarity: 0.3888888888888889
Abstract: In the wake of the tragic shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida on February 14th, many of the school's students have pushed hard for more stringent gun control legislation, only to be met with vitriolic attacks from the right, often accusing them of being 'crisis actors'. Ben Margulies writes that the treatment of these students echoes the way whites treat non-white political opponents: often as ‘enemies’ or ‘aliens’ who are unworthy of civil discourse
Automatic summary: Ben Margulies writes that the treatment of these students echoes the way whites treat non-white political opponents: often as ‘enemies’ or ‘aliens’ who are unworthy of civil discourse. There is little new to say about the United States’ unique gun culture, or about the grievous impact that this culture has on public safety in the country.

Summarization comparison for article: Where are Kampala's missing houses?
Similarity: 0.1686746987951807
Abstract: Kampala is facing a dearth of affordable formal housing. Rural-urban migration, limited access to mortgage finance, and a host of other factors are all straining its housing sector. It is imperative for planners to think of innovative and sustainable ways to address this issue, argue Astrid Haas and Thierry Hoza Ngoga
Automatic summary: Land tenure and housing finance are only two of the reasons driving the housing gap in the city. Slums and land tenure As a result of lack of access to formal housing, Kampala has become home to a large number of slums. Furthermore, to keep pace with the urban growth of the city, it is estimated that the housing stock would have to increase by a further 29,000 units per year.

Summarization comparison for article: UK governance after Brexit: yet more variable and even more disjointed
Similarity: 0.12345679012345678
Abstract: Michael Kenny and Jack Sheldon write that, although May's government has been prepared to make various concessions in its dealings with the devolved governments, tricky intergovernmental negotiations relating to Brexit are in line. How these will be managed will be one of the most difficult aspects of the Brexit process
Automatic summary: Its original draft would have prevented the devolved administrations from legislating in all areas currently covered by EU law until the long-term allocation of powers was agreed. In the scenario that no deal is reached, the Scottish and Welsh governments would seek to pass their ‘continuity bills’.

Summarization comparison for article: EU students at UK universities: patterns and trends
Similarity: 0.16546762589928057
Abstract: What Brexit will mean for UK universities varies from institution to institution. Much data on Brexit's impact focuses on sector-wide aggregates, the forest that hides the trees. The UK provides excellent teaching and research, as illustrated by the number of its universities ranked in the top 10, 50 or 100 in the world. Yet despite its world-class reputation, the UK's higher education sector is hierarchical, and various layers will be affected differently. Ludovic Highman (UCL) explores the sector’s diversity in this regard
Automatic summary: Currently they are treated as home students, but in all likelihood EU students enrolling in the UK after its withdrawal in March 2019 will be treated as overseas students. The diversity of the student fabric of UK universities, so crucial to the overall student experience, depends on a healthy number of non-UK based students interacting with domestic students. Scottish universities are attractive to non-UK EU students in absolute numbers, with Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen attracting more than Oxbridge and competing with the top London universities. EU students graduate from rigorous secondary school systems and their drive to study abroad, most often in a language that is not theirs, makes them attractive to UK universities. It is possible that higher concentrations of EU students will further relocate to Scotland, though this depends on the level of fees charged beyond 2020.

Summarization comparison for article: Book review: war in 140 characters: how social media is reshaping conflict in the twenty-first century by David Patrikarakos
Similarity: 0.3170731707317073
Abstract: In War in 140 Characters: How Social Media is Reshaping Conflict in the Twenty-First Century, David Patrikarakos explores how social media is shifting the power balance from governments and institutions towards individuals and networks and the impact this is having on contemporary warfare. Relating the personal stories of individuals caught up in conflict, this book underscores the centrality of narratives and storytelling to understanding the changing face of war today, writes Madeline McSherry
Automatic summary: These individuals and their stories are on the frontlines of his new book, War in 140 Characters: How Social Media is Reshaping Conflict in the Twenty-First Century. Nowhere is this transfer of power more evident than in the story of Eliot Higgins, the obsessive online gamer whose social media investigation challenged a global superpower.

Summarization comparison for article: Book review: how to be a geek: essays on the culture of software by Matthew Fuller
Similarity: 0.24096385542168675
Abstract: In How to be a Geek: Essays on the Culture of Software, Matthew Fuller explores the bits and bytes that have reshaped our world through a collection of essays that examines the figure of the geek and software cultures. While the lack of cohesive thread and use of terminology means this collection is best suited to scholars already familiar with the field rather than newcomers, the book contains some useful and astute insights, writes Wendy Liu
Automatic summary: Overall, How To Be a Geek is a useful addition to the field of software studies, geared primarily toward academics who are already enmeshed in the field. This is the scene onto which Matthew Fuller’s How To Be a Geek: Essays on the Culture of Software has emerged.

Summarization comparison for article: Book review: the Rohingyas: inside Myanmar's genocide by Azeem Ibrahim
Similarity: 0.23076923076923078
Abstract: This updated edition of The Rohingyas: Inside Myanmar’s Genocide, authored by Azeem Ibrahim, aims to draw further attention to the ongoing atrocities being committed against the Rohingyas in Myanmar and to challenge some of the overarching myths that lie behind the persecutions. While she would have welcomed a deeper engagement with the legal components of the situation from the perspective of international law, Ebru Demir recommends this as a welcome contribution to the literature that will give readers insight into the historical roots of the crisis
Automatic summary: Find this book: The publication of an updated version of Azeem Ibrahim’s book, The Rohingyas: Inside Myanmar’s Genocide, is very timely considering the current situation in Myanmar. Yet, having read Ibrahim’s book, this seems unlikely to address the root causes of the situation and to guarantee non-repetition for the victims.

Summarization comparison for article: What Germany's grand coalition means for European defence and security
Similarity: 0.28735632183908044
Abstract: Following months of coalition negotiations, a new German government has finally taken office. But what does the new government mean for the EU? Alessandra Pozzi Rocco writes that with her next term in power now secured, Merkel has the chance to craft EU history further, notably by forging ahead on common defence and security
Automatic summary: What Germany’s grand coalition means for European defence and security Following months of coalition negotiations, a new German government has finally taken office. Starting off on the right foot, there is great potential for advancement in the field of security and defence policy. There is a good reason to believe Berlin will take more decisive steps out of necessity, but with an even-handed approach with regards to defence, development and cooperation.

Summarization comparison for article: Finding a way out of the Catalan labyrinth
Similarity: 0.11965811965811966
Abstract: Almost four months after regional elections, Catalonia still has no government, and there is no end in sight in the stand-off over Catalan independence. Astrid Barrio and Bonnie N. Field write that there remain major international and judicial impediments to forming a new government, as well as notable splits in opinion within the pro-independence movement on the best strategy to pursue. And with political actors reaching an impasse, street protests and direct action initiatives have started to fill the vacuum
Automatic summary: What’s more, Spain’s government does not consider a hypothetical government, led by Puigdemont from afar, to be an effective government. That debate was urgently convened when the court ordered Turull, other accused members of the former government, and former parliamentary speaker Carme Forcadell to appear in court. The Catalan independence movement has seized upon this to again propose Sánchez’s candidacy, pending a court ruling, with the investiture debate set for 13 April.

Summarization comparison for article: The more revisions a paper undergoes, the greater its subsequent recognition in terms of citations
Similarity: 0.21739130434782608
Abstract: Is the peer review process simply a means by which errors are identified and corrected? Or is it a process in which a more constructive dialogue can take place and reviewers and editors may actively contribute to the text? John Rigby, Deborah Cox and Keith Julian have studied the published articles of a social sciences journal and found that the more revisions a paper undergoes, the greater its subsequent recognition in terms of citations
Automatic summary: Peer review needs to be recognised not as an event but as a process, often a long one, and one in which a constructive dialogue can take place. Our paper is part of a long-running effort to open the “black box” of peer review. Our work throws up an interesting paradox – at least an interesting paradox for those who hold that peer review is error correction.

Summarization comparison for article: It's not enough for research to be useful to policy actors, we must try to actually influence change
Similarity: 0.17142857142857143
Abstract: There is no doubt that good communications and framing research and evidence for your audience is important to influencing policy and having research impact. But shouldn't we be aiming higher than producing and packaging research that simply meets the demands of policy actors? Surely what we actually want to do is influence change, not reinforce social and political norms? James Georgalakis argues that research and researchers need to challenge dominant paradigms and expose inconvenient truths. Relationships, networks, and bodies of knowledge play a far more significant role in change processes than short-term communications campaigns on specific research reports
Automatic summary: The first is the simple one favoured by research donors and think tanks that says that research, if packaged correctly, can directly “enlighten” policy actors. We try and overcome academics’ nervousness about policy engagement by demonstrating that research rigour and policy engagement can be mutually reinforcing. However, another model describes how by trying to shape research and evidence for policy we may actually allow politics to shape knowledge. Academics’ anxiety over engaging in policy, which can sometimes seem very inconvenient, centres less on the issue of measurement and more on the fundamental relationship between evidence and policy. The semi-professional disciplines of both policy influence and research impact always attract the communications crowd.

Summarization comparison for article: We need more carrots: give academic researchers the support and incentives to share data
Similarity: 0.3
Abstract: Making data available for other researchers to find, use, reuse, and reproduce is fundamental to open science, and ultimately makes research more efficient and effective. Yet despite funder policies that encourage and require data sharing, researchers in both the UK and the US report lower percentages of data sharing than the global average. In addition to progressive policies, Grace Baynes suggests researchers should be given incentives, expert support, training, and the infrastructure to make it seamless and easy to share data, and worth their while. Governments, funders, research institutions, libraries, and publishers all have a role to play to unlock the huge potential of research data
Automatic summary: Yet despite funder policies that encourage and require data sharing, researchers in both the UK and the US report lower percentages of data sharing than the global average. Our findings, Practical Challenges for Researchers in Data Sharing, are openly accessible in Figshare along with the survey data. While sharing data as supplementary information is better than not sharing data at all, it is a sub-optimal solution. Initiatives such as DataCite and the Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles help make research data more citable and discoverable.

Summarization comparison for article: The neurotic academic: how anxiety fuels casualised academic work
Similarity: 0.21739130434782608
Abstract: As higher education undergoes a process of marketisation in the UK and the activities of academic staff are increasingly measured and scrutinised, universities are suffused with anxiety. Coupled with pressures facing all staff, casualised academics face multiple forms of insecurity. While anxiety is often perceived as an individual problem for which employees are encouraged to take personal responsibility, Vik Loveday argues that anxiety amongst academic staff should be understood in two ways: as a symptom of casualised work in an increasingly competitive environment; and as a tactic of governance, ensuring compliance
Automatic summary: This blog post is based on the author’s article, “The neurotic academic: anxiety, casualisation, and governance in the neoliberalising university”, published in the Journal of Cultural Economy (DOI: 10.1080/17530350.2018.1426032). Anxiety, then, can be conceptualised as a kind of “tactic” of governance: fuelling hard work, a striving for so-called “excellence”, and the creation of obedient academic subjects. It will come as no surprise to those working in the UK’s higher education (HE) sector that universities are currently suffused with anxiety.

Summarization comparison for article: PhD students supervised collectively rather than individually are quicker to complete their theses
Similarity: 0.25274725274725274
Abstract: Given the choice, most PhD students would prefer to receive individual supervision rather than be supervised alongside their peers as part of a collective. This is understandable, given the undivided attention and precise, directly relevant advice one would receive. However, Hans Agné and Ulf Mörkenstam have compared the experiences of individually and collectively supervised students on the same doctoral programme and found that collective supervision, during the first year at least, is correlated with significantly shorter times to thesis completion compared to individual supervision
Automatic summary: Studied in this way, it appears that collective supervision of first-year doctoral students is correlated with significantly shorter times to thesis completion compared to individual supervision. Students who received collective supervision in the first year averaged 57 months in the programme, while students receiving individual supervision averaged 92 months. Multivariate statistical analyses of these observations support the conclusion that collective supervision in the first year does indeed reduce the time to completion of doctoral students.

Summarization comparison for article: Book review: deconstructing Dirty Dancing by Stephen Lee Naish
Similarity: 0.15384615384615385
Abstract: In Deconstructing Dirty Dancing, Stephen Lee Naish unpacks the enduring popularity of the film Dirty Dancing, released to mixed reviews in 1987 before going on to become a global hit. Offering a comparative study of the film with David Lynch’s Blue Velvet before a scene-by-scene analysis and reflections on the film’s personal resonance for the author, the book is an idiosyncratic and accessible take on this cultural phenomenon, finds Penny Montague
Automatic summary: The essay is an absorbing account of his uneven relationship with the film, which will resonate with a wide range of readers, whether fans of the film or otherwise. Throughout this section of the book, Naish analyses and illuminates each moment of the film, its dialogue, music, wardrobe, plot and themes, particularly drawing out its political threads.

Summarization comparison for article: Svexit or Huxit? How another country could follow the UK out of the EU
Similarity: 0.13725490196078433
Abstract: What are the chances of another country following the UK out of the EU? Eurosceptics in other states may be emboldened by the deal the UK manages to secure, especially if it includes access to the Single Market. Moves to further EU integration could have a similar effect. Simon Hix (LSE) and Nick Sitter (Central European University) look at the cases of Hungary and Sweden
Automatic summary: A scenario that would see Sweden as the next country to leave the EU would have to involve a substantial change in the cross-party political consensus on European integration. The most realistic basis for such a scenario would involve the emergence of a model of European integration that is more attractive for Sweden than full EU membership. Should Brexit lead to a new model that is more attractive than the EEA, the benefits of EU membership might seem less obvious. Second, a successful soft Brexit could conceivably provide an attractive alternative to full EU membership.

Summarization comparison for article: Book review: fire and fury: inside the Trump White House by Michael Wolff
Similarity: 0.18556701030927836
Abstract: With the overnight international bestseller Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, Michael Wolff utilises his ‘semipermanent seat’ on a West Wing sofa to offer an insider account of the Trump administration. While critical of Wolff’s writing style, methods and failure to separate clear falsehoods from certainties, Jonny Hall concedes that the book remains a gripping read that is at its most revealing when discussing the warring factions shaping Trump’s Presidency
Automatic summary: In sum, I would contend that this book is slightly more accurate than is generally being portrayed, but Wolff’s methods and writing style hardly aid his cause. This is one of the grievances of what Wolff or Trump might call the ‘mainstream media’: that Wolff’s book is simply ‘gossip’, and that ‘gossip isn’t journalism’.

Similarity: 0.15083798882681565
Abstract: Academia.edu has been called "Facebook for academics," and the analogy is fitting: Academia.edu mimics core social-media conventions, down to follower counts, curated profiles with pics, and a scrollable "News Feed" bulletin of followers’ uploads. But its reliance on user-facing metrics exceeds anything you’ll find on mainstream social media. It comes with a dedicated "Analytics" page resembling a gaming leaderboard or a corporation’s annual report. The charts and graphs encourage incessant monitoring, which dovetails with university policies that seek to measure quantifiable "impact." The result? Scholars are internalizing an analytics mind-set
Automatic summary: Scholars upload their paywalled papers, which become Google-indexed PDFs; the company uses these to draw in new members; the audience increases, prompting more scholars to upload their work. t most universities, annual evaluations and tenure decisions hinge on numbers: article counts, journal impact factors, h-index scores, and, perhaps, standardized teaching evaluations. This essay is based on an article, written with Brooke Erin Duffy, an assistant professor of communication at Cornell University, that recently appeared in Social Media + Society. With the audit culture lodged inside us, we don’t even need a warped incentive structure to overproduce papers and game the numbers. But now Academia.edu invites us to measure ourselves — to incorporate page views and download counts into our intellectual identities. "Academia is the easiest way to share papers with millions of people across the world for free," proclaims the site.

Similarity: 0.026217228464419477
Abstract: This present study analyses the effects of the concentration of solids in the over-elevation phenomenon in a canalwith a 180° curvature and a constant trapezoidal transversal section, with a firm bed, the fluid has a non-colloidal,mono-disperse distribution of relatively spherical particles of 1mm in size, thus making the rheology of the flow de-scribable by the Einstein-Roscoe equation (1). Two stages are proposed for the development of the research; the firstcorresponds to physical experimentation, achieved using an artificial canal, in which 420 tests were carried out usingdifferent concentration of solids and two slopes, in order to determine the behaviour of the bi-phased flow. All of thisis carried out by using experimental results and results obtained from numerical models. The data collected from theexperimental process is compared to the results obtained from the theoretical models that are reported in literature.An over-elevation equation was formulated from the analysis, which can be used for the bi-phased conditions de-scribed in this article. During the second phase, numerical modelling using the TITAN2F software was carried out,where laboratory conditions are replicated. Data found from numerical modelling is compared with experimentalresults, with the intention of validating the numerical model that TITAN2F uses. From what is mentioned above, itwas deduced that TITAN2F effectively reproduces the hydraulic phenomenon. However, it is also observed that theprogram has a low susceptibility to changes in the concentration of solids, due to the scale being use

Summarization comparison for article: Extending Internet to Powerless Areas
Similarity: 0.2545454545454545
Abstract: Literature ReviewThe lack of internet in undeveloped countries and other rural areas is detrimental to the development of the area. Access to internet can have many profound effects on developing countries such as creating economic opportunities for small and medium sized businesses (Meltzer) and improving education (Purdue). In many of these rural areas and developing countries, such as Africa, children do not have up to date education (The Economist), people struggle to find jobs (ACET), and the infrastructure is lacking (The World Bank). The lack of internet in areas that have been affected by natural disasters is also a large problem that our society faces. Areas where the cellular towers and power generators were knocked out would benefit greatly from connectivity because it would allow the affected community to communicate with outside help.  One example of when internet needed to be extended to an area affected by disaster is Puerto Rico after Hurricane Irma knocked out over 90% of their cell service (Fiegerman). Some companies have attempted to create solar powered wi-fi hotspots, but none of them are implemented in the way that we plan to solve the problem. No product exists that can provide internet without cellular coverage nor a power grid. However, there are a couple of products that are in our area of research. The company Soluxio has created a solar powered wi-fi extender/LTE wi-fi hotspot. This is primarily for creating outdoor wi-fi networks in places with an existing internet connection or for resorts and city parks in developed areas where LTE data is available (Soluxio). The company Moja has created a microserver that also connects to LTE data. This device has the option to be solar powered, but it also has the same limitation as the Soluxio device in that it relies on LTE data which does not cover a large portion of the globe (Moja). Thesis Statement Design a system/device that can provide internet to areas that do not have reliable power or cellular coverage

Our device needs to be able to power itself, and maybe even provide some excess power to the client. Housing Design 17 Solar Panel Mount Design The only components that will not be kept in the HDPE housing will be the solar panels and satellite dish. That is why we have taken on the task to design a system/device that can provide internet to areas that do not have reliable power or cellular coverage. There are many areas in the world that do not have or have very sparse internet connections; some areas may even lack reliable power. Thesis Statement Design a system/device that can provide internet to areas that do not have reliable power or cellular coverage. Solar Panel Roof Mount The roof mount design is less expensive than the pole mount design, however it can only be used in areas with the proper infrastructure. Since many use cases for our device involves disaster relief areas, the device also needs to be able to withstand very rough climates and weather conditions. Our system is capable of producing its own power and sustaining itself and even 14 some excess power to the client. Since most of the Puerto Ricans do not have power or lights still, it would be imperative to have some sort of power source functionality. Areas where the cellular towers and power generators were knocked out would benefit greatly from connectivity because it would allow the affected community to communicate with outside help. No product exists that can provide 2 internet without cellular coverage nor a power grid.

Abstract: In its review of the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs), the European Commission is proposing a radical expansion of the competences of the European Securities Markets Authority (ESMA), but without changing the final decision-making structure of the ESAs. Such a change of scale, creating important new powers for ESMA in capital markets’ supervisory functions for the EU-27, was not expected by most market participants. With the biggest financial centre soon leaving the EU, the review introduces some provisions on future cooperation with third countries but outside any strategic thinking about the competitiveness and attractiveness of the post-Brexit Capital Markets Union (CMU)
Automatic summary: Such a change of scale, creating important new powers for ESMA in capital markets’ supervisory functions for the EU-27, was not expected by most market participants. Regrettably, the proposal has not explored the possibility of giving permanent executives a vote on supervisory issues within the Supervisory Board.

Abstract: The essays in this interdisciplinary volume explore language, broadly construed, as part of the continued interrogation of the boundaries of human and nonhuman animals in the Middle Ages. Uniting a diverse set of emerging and established scholars, Animal Languages questions the assumed medieval distinction between humans and other animals. The chapters point to the wealth of non-human communicative and discursive forms through which animals function both as vehicles for human meaning and as agents of their own, demonstrating the significance of human and non-human interaction in medieval texts, particularly for engaging with the Other. The book ultimately considers the ramifications of deconstructing the medieval anthropocentric view of language for the broader question of human singularity

Summarization comparison for article: Assessment of expression of interferon γ (IFN-G) gene and its antisense (IFNG-AS1) in breast cancer
Similarity: 0.43902439024390244
Abstract: Background  The role of long non-coding RNAs has been extensively appreciated in the contexts of cancer. Interferon γ-antisense RNA1 (IFNG-AS1) is an lncRNA located near to IFN-γ-encoding (IFNG) gene and regulates expression of IFNG in Th1 cells. Methods  In the present study, we evaluated expression of IFNG and IFNG-AS1 in 108 breast samples including tumoral tissues and their adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANCTs) using real-time PCR. IFNG-AS1 was significantly upregulated in tumoral tissues compared with ANCTs (expression ratio = 2.23, P = 0.03). Results  Although the expression of IFNG was higher in tumoral tissues compared with ANCTs (relative expression = 1.89), it did not reach the level of significance (P = 0.07). IFNG expression was significantly higher in HER2-negative tumoral tissues compared with HER2-positive ones (P = 0.01) and in grade 1 samples compared with grade 2 ones (P = 0.03). No other significant difference was found in expressions of genes between other groups. Conclusion Significant strong correlations were detected between expression of IFNG and IFNG-AS1 in both tumoral tissues and ANCTs. The present study provides evidences for participation of IFNG and IFNG-AS1 in the pathogenesis of breast cancer and warrants future studies to elaborate the underlying mechanism
Automatic summary: IFNG expression was significantly higher in HER2-negative tumoral tissues compared with HER2-positive ones (P = 0.01) and in grade 1 samples compared with grade 2 ones (P = 0.03). In spite of several efforts to evaluate the effi- ciency of IFN-γ treatment in breast cancer, data regarding expression of IFNG gene in breast cancer tissues is scarce. Methods: In the present study, we evaluated expression of IFNG and IFNG-AS1 in 108 breast samples including tumoral tissues and their adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANCTs) using real-time PCR. Results: Although the expression of IFNG was higher in tumoral tissues compared with ANCTs (relative expression = 1.89), it did not reach the level of significance (P = 0.07). Expression analysis Relative expressions of IFNG and IFNG-AS1 genes were assessed in tumoral tissues and paired ANCTs in the rotor gene 6000 Corbett Real-Time PCR System. Table 3 shows the results of association analysis between relative expressions of genes in tumoral tissues compared with ANCTs and patients’ clinicopath- ological data. Elevated expression of IFNG-AS1 lncRNA has been reported in Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT) patients in correlation with the proportion of circulating Th1 cells and IFNG gene expression . We compared expression level of IFNG and IFNG-AS1 in each tumoral tissue vs. its paired ANCT and classified patients based on these values to upregulation and downregulation groups. No significant associations were found between patients’ clinicopathological data and fold changes of ex- pression of these genes in tumoral tissues compared with ANCTs.

Summarization comparison for article: Immunotherapy in Allergic Rhinitis: It's Effect on the Immune System and Clinical Symptoms
Similarity: 0.2903225806451613
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis is one of the most common allergic diseases and characterised by sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion and nasopharyngeal itching. Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) for specific allergens is an effective treatment and induces the inhibitory effect of T regulatory lymphocytes and decreases clinical symptoms in allergic rhinitis. AIM: In this study effect of subcutaneous immunotherapy with specific allergens on clinical symptoms and T regulatory and T Helper cells cytokines, in patients with allergic rhinitis are evaluated. METHODS: In this study, 30 patients with moderate to severe allergic rhinitis according to clinical criteria and positive skin prick test for aeroallergens were selected and treated by SCIT. Clinical symptoms and T cells cytokines IL4, IL17, IFN gamma, TGF beta, GITR, FOXP3 and IL-10 (by RT-PCR) were evaluated before and one year after initiation of treatment. RESULTS: Thirty (30) patients with allergic rhinitis at age range 15-45 years old were treated by SCIT, and 23 (14 female, 9 male) patients continued the study, and 7 patients did not continue treatment. After immunotherapy, clinical symptoms decreased significantly. The specific cytokines TGF beta and IL10 levels increased and changes were statistically significant. (Respectively P = 0.013 and P = 0.05) The IL17 level was also increased, but not statistically significant. (P = 0.8) IFN gamma, IL4, GITR, FOXP3, all decreased, but the changes were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Subcutaneous Immunotherapy for specific allergens decreases clinical symptoms in patients with allergic rhinitis and induces tolerance in T lymphocytes, especially by increasing T regulatory cells cytokines, TGF beta and IL10

Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) for specific allergens is an effective treatment and induces the inhibitory effect of T regulatory lymphocytes and decreases clinical symptoms in allergic rhinitis. Immunotherapy in Allergic Rhinitis: It’s Effect on the Immune System _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Open Access Maced J Med Sci. It seems that immunotherapy has a major role in the induction of specific Treg cells and that the induction of tolerance in T lymphocytes is the base of immunotherapy. In our study, a significant decrease was observed in the clinical symptoms of allergic rhinitis patients after immunotherapy. Natural Treg cells react to autoantibodies which are expressed in the thymus whereas Inducable Treg cells react towards peripheral antigens which are expressed by dendritic cells . In the mentioned study those Treg cells originating from the thymus were named as nT-reg cells, and those forming outside the thymus were called aT-reg (adaptive) cells . In a study by Jutel et al., in 2003 in Switzerland, the mechanism of immunotherapy was studied in HDM- sensitive patients after 70 days of immunotherapy. The present study aimed at evaluating the effect of immunotherapy on the clinical symptoms and cytokine changes related to T lymphocytes in moderate to severe AR patients. Each of these subsets has a specific marker and express their specific receptors which for nTreg cells include CCR4/GITR/CTLA4/CD62L and for iTreg cells include IL10/TGF-beta. Figure 1: Response to immunotherapy after one year according to age Regarding sex and response to immunotherapy; no meaningful response was obtained (P = 0.7).

Summarization comparison for article: Effects of Zingiber officinale hydro-alcoholic extract on\ud
HMG-COA reductase level in the testis of streptozotocininduced diabetic rats
Similarity: 0.3427230046948357
Abstract: Introduction: Zingiber officinale Roscoe, commonly known as ginger, is used as a cooking spice and therapeutically for its antioxidant and androgenic activities. We investigated the effects of Z. officinale hydro-alcoholic extract on HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase level in the testis of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Methods: The current experimental study was performed on four groups of male Wistar rats one of them was kept as a healthy control, while the others were rendered diabetic via a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (60 mg kg-1). One group was considered as diabetic control; while the others were given orally hydro-alcoholic extract (200 and 400 mg kg-1) for 56 consecutive days. Body weight, blood glucose and insulin concentrations were evaluated using standard methods. The HMG-COA reductase level was determined by western blot analysis. Results: Treatment with the extract resulted in a significant reduction of serum glucose concentration and HMG-COA reductase level in the rat’s testis compared to diabetic controls (P<0.01). A significant increase in body weight was observed in treated diabetic rats. Also, serum insulin was significantly increased in diabetic rats treated with 400 mg/kg of the extract compared to diabetic controls (P<0.05). Conclusion: Ginger has a potential influence on the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis by modulating of HMG-COA reductase level. The results provide scientific evidence to confirm the traditional use of Z. officinale in the treatment of diabetes mellitus
Automatic summary: On the other hand, serum insulin level was significantly higher in diabetic rats treated with 400 mg/kg of Z. officinale extract than diabetic controls (29,30). Conclusion The oral administration of Z. officinale hydro-alcoholic extract has been shown to increases body weight, reduce blood glucose concentration and improve serum insulin levels in STZ-induced diabetic rats. Raw ginger extract can decrease serum cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels in diabetic rats and it has the great effect for controlling of diabetic complications (32). We investigated the effects of Z. officinale hydro-alcoholic extract on HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase level in the testis of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. According to the present study, Z. officinale extract can prevent weight loss in rats with STZ-induced diabetic and this effect may be related to its hypoglycemic properties. Some studies have shown that the ethanol extract of Z. officinale alleviates plasma lipids in cholesterol fed hyperlipidemia rabbits (12,13) and in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats (14). Also, serum insulin was significantly increased in diabetic rats treated with 400 mg/kg of the extract compared to diabetic controls (P < 0.05). Results: Treatment with the extract resulted in a significant reduction of serum glucose concentration and HMG-COA reductase level in the rat’s testis compared to diabetic controls (P < 0.01). Anti- diabetic and anti-oxidant effects of Zingiber officinale on alloxan-induced and insulin-resistant diabetic male rats. The effect of Z. officinale extract on the body weight, insulin level, and fasting blood glucose concentrations were assessed and the results are presented elsewhere (19).

Similarity: 0.10270270270270271
Abstract: Erworben im Rahmen der Schweizer Nationallizenzen (http://www.nationallizenzen.ch)More and more academic studies and practitioner reports claim that human work is increasingly disrupted or even determined by information and communication technology (ICT) (Cascio and Montealegre 2016). This will make a considerable share of jobs currently performed by humans susceptible to automation (e.g., Frey and Osborne 2017; Manyika et al. 2017). These reports often sketch a picture of ‘machines taking over’ traditional domains like manufacturing, while ICT advances and capabilities seem to decide companies’ fate. Consequently, ICT is often put at the core of innovative efforts. While this applies to nearly all areas of workplace design, a recent popular example of increasing technology centricity is ‘Industry 4.0’, which is often delineated as ‘machines talking to computers’
Automatic summary: Digital work designers must understand how and why things work before they can provide a digital solution to support work practices. 1 shows, traditional work design touches on motivational (e.g., autonomy and task variety), social (e.g., interdependence), and contextual (e.g., ergonomics) work design characteristics. 2 The Roots and Key Characteristics of Digital Work Design Workplace design has a long-standing tradition in ergo- nomics (Luczak 2013) and human-oriented computer sci- ence (Floyd et al.

If one accepts this change in the nature of work, researchers and practitioners need new approaches to analyze and (re)design work practices.

Summarization comparison for article: On the Obsolescence of Bourgeois Theory in the Anthropocene
Similarity: 0.1693121693121693
Abstract: ‘On the Obsolescence of Bourgeois Theory in the Anthropocene’ is an attempt to think theory beyond the stereotypes of what it is considered to be. This includes preconceived notions of what it is to be a  theorist, and to create, publish and disseminate critical theory.Many thinkers, for example, are currently attempting to replace the tyranny of the human with an emphasis on the nonhuman, the posthuman and the Anthropocene. Yet such ‘post-theory’ theorists continue to remain bound up with the human in the very performance of their attempts to think through and beyond it. Regardless of the anti-humanist philosophies they profess — be they inspired by Deleuze, Kittler or Latour  — in their practices, in the forms their work takes, in the ways they create, publish and disseminate it, in their associated upholding of notions of individual human rights, freedom, property and so on, they continue to operate in terms of a liberal, humanist model of what it is to be and do as a theorist. ‘On the Obsolescence of Bourgeois Theory in the Anthropocene’ thus asks, what forms is critical theory to take if, in its performance, it is not to be simply liberal and humanist — nor indeed human — but something else besides? In this way it endeavours to anticipate a future where new roles and conditions for theory materialize that has never previously been imagined
Automatic summary: The nonhuman may be what a lot of contemporary theory studies and writes about, then, but it cannot take seriously the implications of the nonhuman for theory. Like the bourgeois novel, such theory — with rare exceptions — ‘draws a sharp distinction between the human and the nonhuman’, not to mention the ‘collective and collaborative’. Certainly, from the point of view of bourgeois theory, that which is outside its inherited liberal humanist frame in this respect can only appear as ‘strange’, ‘weird’, ‘freaky’. Just as ‘serious fiction, like bourgeois culture, now seems rather unserious, indeed frivolous’, so too does serious theory. For if the inhuman equals the human intertwined with the nonhuman, then a humanities with this intra-active inhuman figure at their heart must become the inhumanities. For ours is a time when theory too can be said to obscure rather than express the changing nature of the times and the time of nature.

Abstract: Feedback mechanisms are critical to iteratively improving most societal systems, and yet there is minimal documentation on the best practices of leveraging feedback to improve teaching and learning in higher education. We attest that facilitated dialogues have the potential to start conversations relevant to improving policy that otherwise would not transpire. In higher education, facilitated dialogues between students, faculty, staff, and administration provide a unique face-to-face opportunity for all participants to provide feedback to one another on real-time institutional strengths and weaknesses. More specifically, facilitated dialogues have the potential to start a conversation on improving the learning in higher education. This work notes the theory facilitated dialogues and offers discussion on the long-term potential for such conversations to serve as a medium for iterative feedback in larger societal systems. Further, this thesis documents our development of a facilitated dialogue, The Student-Faculty Dialogue, which will act as a plenary event at Texas A&M?s inaugural Transformational Teaching and Learning Conference on April 17, 2018
Automatic summary: 5 CHAPTER I METHODS Plenary Event Structure We developed a framework for a two-hour facilitated dialogue event through iterative analysis of small scale student-faculty dialogue events. This event will accommodate a diverse group of approximately 100 students and 100 faculty members who are interested in learning how to enhance the classroom experience for both parties. Facilitation Results from the Student-Faculty Dialogue event and associated discussion will be released following the plenary event on April 17, 2018. The plenary conference event closes with time for audience participation in defining the event’s call to action. Right image – Small scale Student-Faculty Dialogue to prepare for 200-participant April 17th plenary conference event in the student union. A student-faculty dialogue is a highly beneficial event for both parties to attend and can lead to an increase in student confidence, classroom conversations and reciprocal compassion.

Summarization comparison for article: Identification and Characterization of a Mutated Gene Affecting NPC assembly
Similarity: 0.3218390804597701
Abstract: The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a gateway that controls what is exchanged across the nuclear envelope. Therefore, when something affects its assembly, the cell will die. The laboratory has a collection of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant strains with NPC assembly defects, but where these defects are located and how they are related to NPC assembly remains unknown. The goal of this project is to identify the mutated gene that is causing assembly defects within one of the strains. Fluorescent microscopy was used to confirm the presence of a NPC assembly defect, and the growth rate of the mutant strain was measured at the permissive and nonpermissive temperature. Additionally, a genomic library was used to compliment the temperature sensitive defect as well as NPC assembly defect. Fluorescent microscopy confirmed the presence of an assembly defect. It was additionally found that the growth rate of the mutant was significantly slower at the nonpermissive temperature. Upon completing all transformations, none of the plasmids in the genomic library rescued the mutant. With information still missing by the mechanism of which NPC?s are formed, identifying and characterizing genes that affect NPC assembly can lead to more information about it
Automatic summary: Fluorescent microscopy was used to confirm the presence of a NPC assembly defect, and the growth rate of the mutant strain was measured at the permissive and nonpermissive temperature. Identifying genes that affect nuclear pore complex assembly, or the nuclear pore complex itself, provide more information about this vital process in every eukaryotic organism. Indeed, the wild-type cells shows a bright and continuous GFP pattern around the nucleus, indicating normal assembly and functioning nuclear pore assembly (npa) genes. This difference in growth rate signifies that the npa mutant of KRY141 is temperature sensitive and will fail to adequately grow when shifted to the nonpermissive temperature. Additionally, a tiled genomic library was used to compliment the temperature sensitive defect as well as NPC assembly defect. A yeast genomic library (collection of genomic DNA from yeast) was used to rescue the mutation in order to learn more about what genes affect assembly. The growth rates at room temperature were later used in comparison with the growth rates at the nonpermissive temperature. Genomic Complementation As seen from Table 2, none of the plasmids in the Prelich library were able to successfully rescue the temperature sensitive mutant phenotype (Jones, Prelich et. Doubling times of the wild-type and mutant strains were found at room temperature in order to establish their normal growth rate. As seen in Table 1, the slower doubling time between KRY141 and YGS53 at the nonpermissive temperature supports the fact that the npa defect is temperature sensitive.

Summarization comparison for article: Turkey votes: Snap elections – Turkey at yet another crossroads. EPC Commentary, 15 May 2018
Similarity: 0.22580645161290322
Abstract: On 24 June, Turkey will hold snap presidential and parliamentary elections, almost 17 months earlier than planned. Their outcome is bound to fundamentally transform Turkish politics from a parliamentary system to a presidential governance model, which gives the president sweeping powers.President Erdoğan announced early elections with the expectation that it would boost his and the ruling Justice and Development Party’s (AKP) chances of winning, while also taking the opposition by surprise. However, Turkey’s historically fragmented opposition has swiftly mobilised. For the first time, it has united. Political parties from different backgrounds and ideologies are coming together with one common aim – to defeat Erdoğan and restore a parliamentary system. Still, the ongoing state of emergency, new controversial election laws and an AKP-dominated media will pose a serious challenge to the opposition
Automatic summary: With such influential names joining forces, the combined votes for the opposition parties could prevent Erdoğan from passing the 50% bar in the first round of the presidential elections. For example, Erdoğan could be elected president while the opposition parties win the majority in the parliament. Still, the ongoing state of emergency, new controversial election laws and an AKP-dominated media will pose a serious challenge to the opposition. The ongoing state of emergency, new controversial election laws and an AKP-dominated media will present a significant challenge to the opposition. If a united opposition succeeds, they can take steps to solve many pressing issues, including the polarisation of Turkish society, and return to a parliamentary system. Since the elections were called, the opposition parties have demonstrated an unprecedented level of solidarity and a readiness to make sacrifices.

Abstract: Previous work in the literature has studied gravitational radiation inblack-hole collisions at the speed of light. In particular, it had been provedthat the perturbative field equations may all be reduced to equations in onlytwo independent variables, by virtue of a conformal symmetry at each order inperturbation theory. The Green function for the perturbative field equations ishere analyzed by studying the corresponding second-order hyperbolic operatorwith variable coefficients, instead of using the reduction method from theretarded flat-space Green function in four dimensions. After reduction tocanonical form of this hyperbolic operator, the integral representation of thesolution in terms of the Riemann function is obtained. The Riemann functionsolves a characteristic initial-value problem for which analytic formulaeleading to the numerical solution are derived.Comment: 15 pages, plain Tex.

With the aid of this concept, we establishthe law of total probability and Bayes' theorem in Riesz spaces; we also provean inclusion-exclusion formula in Riesz spaces. Several examples are providedto show that the law of total probability, Bayes' theorem andinclusion-exclusion formula in probability theory are special cases of ourresults
Automatic summary: Law of total probability and Bayes’ theorem in Riesz spaces In probability theory, the law of total probability and Bayes’ theorem are two fundamental theorems involving conditional probability. Conditional probability in Riesz spaces To extend the notion of conditional probability in probability theory to Riesz spaces, we first recall the following definition. A band B in a Riesz space is said to be a projection band if X equals the direct sum of B and Bd, that is, X = B⊕Bd.

Summarization comparison for article: LEAD IN THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE CITY OF DNIPRO AND ITS BIOMONITORING IN THE BODY OF THE PRESCHOOL CHILDREN
Similarity: 0.16853932584269662
Abstract: Among a variety of chemical environmental factors that adversely affect the health of the population, especially dangerous are the heavy metals. The most widespread among them is lead. Numerous researches by scientists indicate the negative impact of this metal on health and, above all, on the health of the children's population. The purpose of the work is a comprehensive hygienic assessment of the content of the lead in environmental objects of an environmentally dangerous area and its impact on the health of children of preschool age. The studies on the content of lead in the air, drinking water, local food products in 2 industrial districts of the city of Dnipro and conditionally clean area have been conducted. Its total daily income in the body of preschool children who live in these areas has been calculated. Its content in the biosubstrates of these children (blood, hair, teeth and urine) has been determined. The obtained data made it expedient and necessary to develop and implement a set of measures, the aim of which is to reduce the external "stress" of this abiotic metal and to increase the resistance and adaptability of the child's body
Automatic summary: Multiple correlation analysis indicates that the lead content in the blood and hair is most closely related to the concentration of the lead in the food. A reliable correlation between the lead content in the environmental objects and its concentration in the children's biosubstrates has been established. At the same time, the lead content in the children's hair is 1.6 times higher than in the adults’, which may be due to its more active absorption. Antonova O. V. Monitoring of the changes of the premorbid indicators of the children's health under the influence of low lead concentrations // Укр. The level of the lead in the blood is the main indicator of its influence on the health of children. A pair correlation analysis found that the content of the lead in the blood is directly proportional to the activity of the δ-ALA and accumulation in the hair. In regional food products, the lead was continuously determined in the concentrations of 0.01 0.1 mg / kg, which is not higher than MLC. This is due to the detection of some neurotoxic disorders of the children exposed to the relatively low and previously perceived as safe levels of the lead.

Abstract: The aim of the study was to evaluate the possible relationship between the quality of restoration of the tooth crown, root canal obturation and periapical status of endodontic teeth. A series of X-ray images from randomly selected patient cards was studied at the Dental Faculty of the Dnepropetrovsk Medical Academy. A total of 1001 endodontically treated teeth restored by permanent restoration were evaluated independently by two experts. According to a predetermined set of radiographic criteria, the technical quality of filling the root canals of the tooth was assessed as good (GE) or poor (PE). In turn, the technical quality of restoration of the tooth crown was also evaluated as good (GR), or poor (PR). Then, the roots of the teeth and the surrounding tissues were evaluated, and according to the available treatment result were classified as successful or unsuccessful. The success rate for all endodontic teeth was 66.4 % (n ‰ 1001). Teeth with root pins had a success rate of 72.7 % (n ‰ 527), the success rate of dental treatment without pins was 64.6% (n ‰ 472). The two groups with technically good endodontics had the highest success rates. In combination with technically good restorations, the success rate was 82% (GE + GR, 82 %), in the case of technically weak restorations, the success rate was 72 % (GE + PR, 72 %). Two groups with technically bad endodontics combined with good restorations or poor restorations had significantly lower success rates (PE + GR, 55 % and PE = PR, 57 %). When assessing the periapical status of endodontic teeth, it was found that the quality of endodontic treatment, evaluated radiographically, is much more important than the quality of restoration of the crown of the tooth
Automatic summary: *The difference between the success rate with Good Endodontics and Poor Endodontics was statistically significant (P<0.0001) re- gardless of the quality of the coronal restoration (GR or PR).

Summarization comparison for article: Solving the dark matter problem through dynamic interactions
Similarity: 0.2689655172413793
Abstract: Owing to the renewed interest in dark matter after the upgrade of the largehadron collider and its dedication to dark matter research it is timely toreassess the whole problem. Considering dark matter is one way to reconcile thediscrepancy between the velocity of matter in the outer regions of galaxies andthe observed galactic mass. So far, no credible candidate for dark matter hasbeen identified. Here, we develop a model accounting for observations byrotations and interactions between rotating objects analogous to magneticfields and interactions with moving charges. The magnitude of these fields isdescribed by a fundamental constant of the order 10-41kg-1. The sameinteractions can be observed in the solar system where they lead to smallchanges in planetary orbits.Comment: 4 pages and 3 figure
Automatic summary: Hence, FR = R(r)×V(r) = −µR MV 20 r er (4) for a suitably chosen value of the rotor constant µR. The field R for positive rotation can then be described by: R (r) = µR ez r ∫ dr′ρ(r′)2pir′V (r′). If rotor fields and their interactions are real, then they must apply to all rotating masses, as well as to the mass within the solar system. Considering dark matter is one way to reconcile the discrepancy between the velocity of matter in the outer regions of galaxies and the observed galactic mass. The assumption that the perihelion advance of Mercury, as shown in Figure 3, is due to rotor fields would allow us to calibrate the rotor field constant. The rotor constant µR can be calculated from existing data with the relationship between velocities V , galactic mass M , and acceleration constant a0.

A set of interior solutionsfound on the basis of the simplest MIT bag model equation of state (EOS) in theform $p=\frac{1}{3}(\rho-4B)$ where $B$ is the bag constant. The proposedinterior metric for the stellar system is consistent with the exteriorSchwarzschild spacetime on the boundary. In addition, we also conduct adetailed study on different tests, viz. the energy conditions, TOV equation,adiabatic index, Buchdahl limit, etc., to verify the physical validity of theproposed model. The numerical value of the used parameters is predicted fordifferent strange star candidates, for different chosen values of the bagconstant. In a nutshell, by exploiting HPM technique first time ever in thefield of relativistic astrophysics, we have predicted in the present literaturea singularity-free and stable stellar model which is suitable to describeultra-dense objects, like strange (quark) stars.Comment: 19 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables, major revisio

Abstract: We study the interesting problem of interaction and identification of thehadronic molecules which seem to be deuteron-like structure. In particular, wepropose a binding mechanism in which One Boson Exchange Potential plus Yukawascreen-like potential is applied in their relative s-wave state. We propose thedipole-like interaction between two color neutral states to form a hadronicmolecule. For the identification of the hadronic molecules, the Weinberg'scompositeness theorem is used to distinguish the molecule from confined(elementary) state. The present formalism predict some di-hadronic molecularstates, involving quarks (s, c, b or $\overline{s}$, $\overline{c}$,$\overline{b}$) as a constituents, namely, $pn$, $K\overline{K}$, $\rho\overline{\rho}$, $K^{*}\overline{K^{*}}$,$D\overline{D^{*}}$($\overline{D}D^{*}$), $D^{*}\overline{D^{*}}$,$B\overline{B^{*}}$, $B^{*}\overline{B^{*}}$,  $D^{*\pm}\overline{D_{1}^{0}}$, $ D^{0}\overline{K^{\pm}}$,$D^{*0}\overline{K^{\pm}}$, with their possible quantum numbers.Comment: 10 page

Let us describe the interaction potential in terms of the well defined One Boson Exchange (OBE) potential and phenomenological attractive screen Yukawa-like potential. The threshold of hadronic molecules consist of doubly heavy quark (c,b or c, b). In general for such bound state, gen- uinely, a simple question arises- How and why two hadrons make a bound state?

Abstract: In this letter we show that communication when restricted to a singleinformation carrier (i.e. single particle) and finite speed of propagation isfundamentally limited for classical systems. On the other hand, quantum systemscan surpass this limitation. We show that communication bounded to the exchangeof a single quantum particle (in superposition of different spatial locations)can result in "two-way signaling" which is impossible in classical physics. Wequantify the discrepancy between classical and quantum scenarios by theprobability of winning a game played by distant players. We generalize ourresult to an arbitrary number of parties and we show that the probability ofsuccess is asymptotically decreasing to zero as the number of parties grows,for all classical strategies. In contrast, quantum strategy allows players towin the game with certainty.Comment: Published version.

  Implications for quantum spin liquids
Similarity: 0.2356687898089172
Abstract: Topological spin liquids can be described by topological gauge theories withglobal symmetry. Due to the presence of both nontrivial bulk deconfined gaugefluxes and global symmetry, topological spin liquids are examples of theso-called "Symmetry Enriched Topological phases" (SET). In this paper, we findthat, in some twisted versions of topological gauge theories (with discreteAbelian gauge group $G_g$), implementing a global symmetry (denoted by $G_s$)is anomalous although symmetry charge carried by topological point-likeexcitations is normally fractionalized and classified by the second cohomologygroup. To demonstrate the anomaly, we fully gauge the global symmetry,rendering a new gauge theory that is not gauge invariant. Therefore, the SETorder of the ground state is anomalous, which cannot exist in 3D system alone.Such anomalous state construction generalizes the "2D surface topologicalorder" to 3D. A concrete example with $G_g=\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_4$ and$G_s=\mathbb{Z}_2$ is calculated.Comment: 4 page
Automatic summary: (5,6), the coefficient q should be quantized as: either q = 8 mod 16 or q = 0 mod 16 such that the new gauge theory is gauge invariant. The coupling term (11) means that all Z4 gauge charge excitations carry Z2 symmetry charge while Z2 gauge charge excitations are not charged under Z2 sym- metry. • The anomalous gauge theory described by the ac- tion (24) may appear as a boundary state of a (4+1)D gauge theory (topological order state). In order to show the anomaly, we fully gauge the global symmetry and obtain a new gauge theory. However, the initial value of q before gauging is q = 4 mod 8, which explicitly leads to violation of gauge invariance in the new gauge the- ory. Therefore, the resulting new gauge theory is a Z2 × Z8 gauge theory with a twisted term.

Similarity: 0.21904761904761905
Abstract: Thus, the score in the range of 5 to 10 is a reliable mark of inflammatory changes in the appendix. At the same time, a direct correlation was found between the depth of inflammatory changes in the appendix walls and the sum of the scores. Thus, in the destructive forms of acute apendicitis, the sum of scores had higher indications than the catarrhal form. Given the erased clinical course of acute appendicitis during pregnancy in most cases, the scale can only be used in conjunction with other diagnostic methods
Automatic summary: Thus, the leukogram indexes have a high informative value in assess- ing the severity of the inflammatory process and destructive changes in acute ap- pendicitis in pregnant women. During laparoscopy, 6 (7.5%) women of the first group showed no signs of inflammation of the appendix, and the diagnosis of acute appendicitis was excluded. Clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis has traditionally come first among other diagnostic methods, but the informative value of many ap- pendicular symptoms during pregnancy is low. Meanwhile, the possibility of a clinical blood test for acute appendicitis in pregnant women is not enough to reveal.

Summarization comparison for article: Memory-Usage Advantageous Block Recursive Matrix Inverse
Similarity: 0.19205298013245034
Abstract: The inversion of extremely high order matrices has been a challenging taskbecause of the limited processing and memory capacity of conventionalcomputers. In a scenario in which the data does not fit in memory, it is worthto consider exchanging less memory usage for more processing time in order toenable the computation of the inverse which otherwise would be prohibitive. Wepropose a new algorithm to compute the inverse of block partitioned matriceswith a reduced memory footprint. The algorithm works recursively to invert oneblock of a $k \times k$ block matrix $M$, with $k \geq 2$, based on thesuccessive splitting of $M$. It computes one block of the inverse at a time, inorder to limit memory usage during the entire processing. Experimental resultsshow that, despite increasing computational complexity, matrices that otherwisewould exceed the memory-usage limit can be inverted using this technique
Automatic summary: With this notation, block Mαβ has dimension b× b, with b = m k , and M = (Mαβ) is a k − by − k block matrix. The proposed algorithm works recursively to invert one block of a k× k block matrix A, with k ≥ 2, based on the successive splitting of A. In , the authors give inverse formulae for 2×2 block matrices applied in block triangular matrices and various structured matrices such as Hamiltonian, per-Hermitian 2 and centro-Hermitian matrices. In , a recursive algorithm is applied for the determination of the first block row of the inverse of a block circulant matrix with circulant blocks. The forward recursive procedure terminates after k − 2 steps, when the resulting frames have 2 × 2 blocks. 〈〈M〉〉 =  〈〈M〉A〉 〈〈M〉B〉 〈〈M〉C〉 〈〈M〉D〉  (36) Thus, 〈〈M〉〉 is a 2 × 2 block matrix generated from the original 4 × 4 block matrix .

Summarization comparison for article: Baryon Production at p-p Collider Experiments: Average Transverse
  Momenta vs. Energy and Mass
Similarity: 0.19047619047619047
Abstract: This paper examines the transverse momentum spectra of baryons in the multiparticle production at modern colliders using Quark-Gluon String Model (QGSM).It discusses 1) the difference in \Lambda^0 hyperon spectra atantiproton-proton vs. proton-proton reactions; 2) the growth of averagetransverse momenta of \Lambda hyperon with proton-proton collision energies and3) the dependence of average p_t on the masses of mesons and baryons at the LHCenergy 7 TeV. This analysis of baryon spectra led to the following conclusions.First, the fragmentation of antidiquark-diquark side of pomeron diagram makesthe major contribution to baryon production spectra in the asymmetricantiproton-proton reaction. Second, the average p_t's of hyperons steadily growwith energy on the range from 53 GeV to 7 TeV. Since no dramatic changes wereseen in the characteristics of baryon production, the hadroproduction processesdo not cause the "knee" in the cosmic ray proton spectra at the energiesbetween Tevatron and LHC. Third, the average transverse momentum analysisthrough examining the different masses of baryons and hadrons reveals theregularity in the mass gaps between hadron generations. This observation givesthe possibility for more hadrons with the masses: 0.253, 0.688, 1.87, 5.09,13.7, 37.3, 101, 276, 749... GeV, which are produced by geometrical progressionwith the mass factor of order 2.71828. Such hadrons with the masses beyond therange of known heavy baryons may be multiquark states like tetraquarks,pentaquarks and so forth.Comment: 11 pages, 11 .eps figures, ICHEP16 poste
Automatic summary: The analysis of average baryon transverse momenta in the framework of QGSM clearly demonstrates that the average transverse momentum of baryons grows steadily with energy (see figure 9). The pomeron diagrams of p − p and p¯ − p collisions are shown in the figure 6. The transverse momentum baryon spectra in antiproton-proton collisions (UA1, UA5, CDF) differ from the pt distributions of baryons in proton-proton collisions (ISR, STAR, LHC). The resulting spectra consist of the contribution from only diquark-antidiquark chain that allows us to see the pure form of baryon transverse momentum distributions in asymmetric case of fragmentation. 3 Baryon Transverse Momentum Distributions in QGSM The QGS Model has been devised for the description of rapidity distributions and hadron spectra in xF 10. 4.1 The Data of UA5 Experiment This subsection discusses the influence of quark composition of beam particles on the shape of transverse momentum spectra of Λ0 hyperon production. The heavy quark meson spectra were fitted with the same formula (1) as the baryon spectra (see the figure 10).

Abstract: The ability to interpret machine learning models has become increasinglyimportant now that machine learning is used to inform consequential decisions.We propose an approach called model extraction for interpreting complex,blackbox models. Our approach approximates the complex model using a much moreinterpretable model; as long as the approximation quality is good, thenstatistical properties of the complex model are reflected in the interpretablemodel. We show how model extraction can be used to understand and debug randomforests and neural nets trained on several datasets from the UCI MachineLearning Repository, as well as control policies learned for several classicalreinforcement learning problems.Comment: Presented as a poster at the 2017 Workshop on Fairness,  Accountability, and Transparency in Machine Learning (FAT/ML 2017

We measure per- formance using accuracy relative to f on a held out test set, i.e., 1 |Xtest | ∑ x ∈Xtest I[T (x) = f (x)].

  Correspondence
Similarity: 0.24324324324324326
Abstract: We speculate on various thermodynamic features of the innerhorizon~(${\mathcal H}^{-}$) and outer horizons~(${\mathcal H}^{+}$) ofKehagias-Sfetsos~(KS) black hole~(BH) in the background of Ho\v{r}ava Lifshitzgravity. We compute particularly the \emph{area product, area sum, area minusand area division} of the BH horizons. We find that they all are \emph{not}showing universal behavior whereas the product is a universal quantity~[Pradhan P., \textit{Phys. Lett. B}, {\bf 747} (2015) {64}]. Based on theserelations, we derive the area bound of all horizons. From the area bound wederive the entropy bound and irreducible mass bound for all thehorizons~(${\mathcal H}^{\pm}$). We also observe that the \emph{First law} ofBH thermodynamics and \emph {Smarr-Gibbs-Duhem } relations do not hold for thisBH. The underlying reason behind this failure due to the scale invariance ofthe coupling constant. Moreover, we compute the\emph{Cosmic-Censorship-Inequality} for this BH which gives the lower bound forthe total mass of the spacetime and it is supported by cosmic cencorshipconjecture. Finally, we discuss the KS/CFT~(Conformal Field Theory)correspondence via a thermodynamic procedure.Comment: Version accepted in EP
Automatic summary: Based on these relations, we computed area bound, entropy bound, irreducible mass bound, temperature bound and specific heat bound. It is also interesting to mentioned that except the area product, entropy product and irreducible mass product all the thermodynamic relations of KS BH are mass dependent. We speculated that area sum, area minus and area division are mass dependent quantities, whereas the product is a mass independent quantity. In our previous study , we derived the surface area product, BH entropy product, surface temperature product, Komar energy product and specific heat product for this BH. Besides the area or entropy product it should be known what happens in case of area sum, area minus and area division. (13) It is remarkable that the area product of KS BH is independent of mass but the area sum is not independent of the mass parameter. From area bound we derive entropy bound and irreducible mass bound for all the horizons (H±). From area bound we derive entropy bound and irreducible mass bound for both the horizons. Likewise, the entropy product and entropy sum of H± becomes: S−S+ = pi 2 4ω2 and S− + S+ = pi ( 4M2 − 1 ω ) . For this reason we extend our study by computing area sum, entropy sum, temperature sum and specific heat sum of all the horizons. We compute particularly area sum, area minus and area division of the BH horizons.

Abstract: We study the precision of parameter estimation for dephasing model undersqueezed environment. We analytically calculate the dephasing factor$\gamma(t)$ and obtain the analytic quantum Fisher information (QFI) for theamplitude parameter $\alpha$ and the phase parameter $\phi$. It is shown thatthe QFI for the amplitude parameter $\alpha$ is invariant in the whole process,while the QFI for the phase parameter $\phi$ strongly depends on the reservoirsqueezing. It is shown that the QFI can be enhanced for appropriate squeezeparameters $r$ and $\theta$. Finally, we also investigate the effect oftemperature on the QFI
Automatic summary: This shows that the squeeze phase parameter θ plays more significant role than the squeeze parameter r in this parameter estimation scheme. The environment ρbath is assumed to be the squeezed vacuum reservoir, which is given by ρbath = ∏ k Sk (r, θ) |0k〉 〈0k|Sk (r, θ) † . The competition between the squeeze parameter r and the squeeze phase parameter θ determines whether the QFI is enhanced or descended in the dephasing process. In this paper, we investigate the effects of reservoir squeez- ing on the estimation precision of the amplitude parameter α ∗Electronic address: quaninformation@sina.com and the phase parameter φ. We analytically calculate the dephasing factor γ(t) and obtain the analytic quantum Fisher information (QFI) for the amplitude parameter α and the phase parameter φ.

There is a central region, where it can be noticed the diffractionof laser light in the region of geometric shadow, while intensity oscillationsare observed in the non-obstructed area. On both sides of the edge, there arealso very long light traces along the normal to the edge of the obstacle. Thetheoretical explanation to this phenomenon is based on the Fresnel-Kirchhoffdiffraction theory applied to the Gaussian beam propagation behind theobstacle. Here we have supplemented this explanation by consideringelectromagnetic flow lines, which provide a more complete interpretation of thephenomenon in terms of electric and magnetic fields and flux lines, and thatcan be related, at the same time, with average photon paths.Comment: 13 pages, 5 figure

Abstract: The consequences of coupling magnetic and elastic degrees of freedom, wherespins and deformations are carried by point-like objects subject to localinteractions, are studied, theoretically and by detailed numerical simulations.From the constrained Lagrangians we derive consistent equations of motion forthe coupled dynamical variables. In order to probe the dynamics of such asystem, we consider external perturbations, such as spin transfer torques forthe magnetic part, and homogeneous stresses for the elastic part, associated totheir corresponding damping. This approach is applied to the study of ultrafastswitching processes in anti-ferromagnetic systems, which have recentlyattracted attention as candidates for anti-ferromagnetic spintronic devices.Our strategy is then checked in simple, but instructive, situations. We carriedout numerical experiments to study, in particular, how the magnetostrictivecoupling and external stresses affect the nature of the switching processes ina prototype anti-ferromagnetic material.Comment: 6 pages, LaTeX2e, 3 figures.

Abstract: We demonstrate a possibility to make rogue waves (RWs) in the form of thePeregrine soliton (PS) and Kuznetsov-Ma breathers (KMBs) effectively stableobjects, with the help of properly defined dispersion or nonlinearitymanagement applied to the continuous-wave (CW) background supporting the RWs.In particular, it is found that either management scheme, if applied along thelongitudinal coordinate, making the underlying nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation(NLSE) selfdefocusing in the course of disappearance of the PS, indeedstabilizes the global solution with respect to the modulational instability ofthe background. In the process, additional excitations are generated, namely,dispersive shock waves and, in some cases, also a pair of slowly separatingdark solitons. Further, the nonlinearity-management format, which makes theNLSE defocusing outside of a finite domain in the transverse direction, enablesthe stabilization of the KMBs, in the form of confined oscillating states. Onthe other hand, a nonlinearity-management format applied periodically along thepropagation direction, creates expanding patterns featuring multiplication ofKMBs through their cascading fission.Comment: Physics Letters A, on pres
Automatic summary: Other panels show snapshots of the managed Peregrine soliton at different values of z, with continuous blue and dashed red lines corresponding, respectively, to the nonlinearity and dispersion management. In the case of KMBs, the input is taken as: u(x, 0) = uKMB(x, 0). (7) In the latter case, the nonlinearity keeps the focusing sign, while the GVD changes from anomalous to normal at z = z1.

Summarization comparison for article: Determining the nature of white dwarfs from low-frequency gravitational
  waves
Similarity: 0.2962962962962963
Abstract: An extreme-mass-ratio system composed of a white dwarf (WD) and a massiveblack hole can be observed by the low-frequency gravitational wave detectors,such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). When the mass of theblack hole is around $10^4 \sim 10^5 M_\odot$, the WD will be disrupted by thetidal interaction at the final inspiraling stage. The event position and timeof the tidal disruption of the WD can be accurately determined by thegravitational wave signals. Such position and time depend upon the mass of theblack hole and especially on the density of the WD. We present the theory byusing LISA-like gravitational wave detectors, the mass-radius relation and thenthe equations of state of WDs could be strictly constrained (accuracy up to$0.1\%$). We also point out that LISA can accurately predict the disruptiontime of a WD, and forecast the electromagnetic follow-up of this tidaldisruption event.Comment: 7 pages, 2 figure
Automatic summary: Such position and time are determined by the mass and radius of WD and the mass of black hole. We find that the tidal radius is independent of the spin of the black hole (BH), but relates with the density of WD and mass of BH. The shadows with different color represent the range of mass and radius of compact object with a tidal disruption event seen by LISA. The measurement uncertainties of the masses of WD and black hole will also contribute to the measurement error of tidal disruption position. For a typical WD (µ = 2), we find that LISA can observe the tidal disruption of a small mass white dwarf (. When the mass of black hole is around 104 ∼ 105M , the WD will be disrupted by the tidal interaction at the final inspiralling stage.

Similarity: 0.16666666666666666
Abstract: A transfer is a group homomorphism from a finite group to an abelian quotientgroup of a subgroup of the group. In this paper, we explain some of theproperties of transfers by using noncommutative determinants. These propertiesenable us to understand transfers more naturally
Automatic summary: Therefore, there exists sgn(g) ∈ {−1, 1} such that Det(g) = det (ψ (LT (g))) = sgn(g) m∏ i=1 {( gti )−1 gti } K = sgn(g)VG→H/K(g). Furthermore, we can show that a transfer is a group homomorphism from G to K and a transfer by left coset representatives equals the transfer by right coset representatives. Thus, we have sgn(gh)VG→H/K(gh) = Det(gh) = Det(g)Det(h) = sgn(g)sgn(h)VG→H/K(g)VG→H/K(h).

Abstract: In this paper we show that both the homotopy category of strict$n$-categories, $1\leqslant n \leqslant \infty$, and the homotopy category ofSteiner's augmented directed complexes are equivalent to the category ofhomotopy types. In order to do so, we first prove an abstract result, based ona strategy of Fritsch and Latch, giving sufficient conditions for a nervefunctor with values in simplicial sets to induce an equivalence at the level ofhomotopy categories. We then apply this result to strict $n$-categories andaugmented directed complexes, for which the hypothesis of our theorem wereestablished by Ara and Maltsiniotis
Automatic summary: We shall call weak equivalences of ∆̂ the usual weak homotopy equivalences and weak equivalences of ∆̂′ the morphisms such that their image by i! This definition provides us with an induced nerve functor at the level of the homotopy categories, that is the categories in which we localise at weak equivalences. We call weak equivalences of Cda the morphisms whose image by N is a weak equivalence of ∆̂.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel automatic face recognition approach based onlocal binary patterns. This descriptor considers a local neighbourhood of apixel to compute the feature vector values. This method is not very robust tohandle image noise, variances and different illumination conditions. We addressthese issues by proposing a novel descriptor which considers more pixels anddifferent neighbourhoods to compute the feature vector values. The proposedmethod is evaluated on two benchmark corpora, namely UFI and FERET facedatasets. We experimentally show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-artmethods and is efficient particularly in the real conditions where the abovementioned issues are obvious. We further show that the proposed method handleswell one training sample issue and is also robust to the image resolution.Comment: Submitted for VCIP 201

Summarization comparison for article: Hand Segmentation for Hand-Object Interaction from Depth map
Similarity: 0.189873417721519
Abstract: Hand segmentation for hand-object interaction is a necessary preprocessingstep in many applications such as augmented reality, medical application, andhuman-robot interaction. However, typical methods are based on colorinformation which is not robust to objects with skin color, skin pigmentdifference, and light condition variations. Thus, we propose hand segmentationmethod for hand-object interaction using only a depth map. It is challengingbecause of the small depth difference between a hand and objects during aninteraction. To overcome this challenge, we propose the two-stage randomdecision forest (RDF) method consisting of detecting hands and segmentinghands. To validate the proposed method, we demonstrate results on the publiclyavailable dataset of hand segmentation for hand-object interaction. Theproposed method achieves high accuracy in short processing time comparing tothe other state-of-the-art methods
Automatic summary: In this paper, we propose the hand segmentation method for hand-object interaction using only a depth map to avoid the limitations of skin color-based methods. Thus, we propose hand segmentation method for hand-object interaction using only a depth map. At each leaf node, the algorithm stores the conditional probability p(h|l) (probability of being each class h given reaching the node l) for the prediction in a testing stage. B. Kang, Y. Lee, and T. Nguyen, “Efficient hand artic- ulations tracking using adaptive hand model and depth map,” in Advances in Visual Computing, Dec. 2015. CONCLUSION In this paper, we present two-stage RDF method for hand seg- mentation for hand-object interaction using only a depth map. The proposed method is compared with the RDF-based method in [1,19] and the fully convolutional networks (FCN) in [24, 25] using only a depth map. Using the inputs (x,D), the algorithm learns a split func- tion at each splitting node and a conditional probability distri- bution at each leaf node.

Similarity: 0.09473684210526316
Abstract: The regularized theories are non-local at the scale of the cutoff, leading soto the usual difficulties of non-local theories. In this work the conservationlaws and causality are investigated for classical field theories withmulti-cluster action. The conservation laws are found to play a lesssignificant role than in local theories because due to the non-locality theconserved quantities are not integrals of the motion, and they can exist evenwithout underlying symmetries. Moreover, the conservation of the energy can notprevent instability brought about by the unbounded nature of the energy frombelow. Hence a sufficient condition of stability is lost. Theories, obtained byappropriate point splitting of local interactions are shown to be causalthereby a necessary condition of stability can be retained.Comment: final version, to appear in Eur. Phys.

Abstract: We analyze the motion of a rod floating in a weightless environment in spacewhen a force is applied at some point on the rod in a direction perpendicularto its length. If the force applied is at the centre of mass, then the rod getsa linear motion perpendicular to its length. However, if the same force isapplied at a point other than the centre of mass, say, near one end of the rod,thereby giving rise to a torque, then there will also be a rotation of the rodabout its centre of mass, in addition to the motion of the centre of massitself. If the force applied is for a very short duration, but impartingnevertheless a finite impulse, like in a sudden (quick) hit at one end of therod, then the centre of mass will move with a constant linear speed andsuperimposed on it will be a rotation of the rod with constant angular speedabout the centre of mass. However, if force is applied continuously, say bystrapping a tiny rocket at one end of the rod, then the rod will spin fasterand faster about the centre of mass, with angular speed increasing linearlywith time. As the direction of the applied force, as seen by an external(inertial) observer, will be changing continuously with the rotation of therod, the acceleration of the centre of mass would also be not in one fixeddirection. However, it turns out that the locus of the velocity vector of thecentre of mass will describe a Cornu spiral, with the velocity vector reachinga final constant value with time. The mean motion of the centre of mass will bein a straight line, with superposed initial oscillations that soon die down.Comment: 8 pages, 4 figures, to appear in Physics Educatio
Automatic summary: With the rotation of the rod, the direction of force f , which is assumed to be always perpendicular to the rod, will change continuously. The centre of mass C of the rod moves with a constant linear velocity v along the y direction. Suppose a force f is applied at some point on the rod, in a direction perpendicular to the length of the rod. But with the rotation of the rod, as the direction of force turns towards the −x direction, C picks up velocity in that direction. If the force applied is at the centre of mass, then the rod gets a linear motion perpendicular to its length. Therefore with respect to C, A has a speed v along y direction while B has a speed v in the opposite direction (Fig. In order to provide a continuous force perpendicular to the length of the rod, we could strap a tiny rocket to the rod at a point of our choosing. In addition, the rod rotates with a constant angular speed ω = 6v/l about C. end of the rod.

Abstract: An uniformly accelerated (Rindler) observer will detect particles in theMinkowski vacuum, known as Unruh effect. The spectrum is thermal and thetemperature is given by that of the Killing horizon, which is proportional tothe acceleration. Considering these particles are kept in a thermal bath withthis temperature, we find that the correlation function of the random force dueto radiation acting on the particles as measured by the accelerated frame,shows the fluctuation-dissipation relation. It is observed that thecorrelations, in both ($1+1$) spacetime and ($1+3$) dimensional spacetimes, areof Brownian type. We discuss the implications of this new observation at theend.Comment: The para above Eq. (6) has been modified, to appear in Phys. Rev. 
Automatic summary: Hence for our practical purpose we keep our region of integra- tion from X = X(T ) to X →∞. Following the steps of , we obtain F (T ) = −X ′(T )T 01[T,X(T )] + T 00[T,X(T )] , (2) where X ′(T ) = dX/dT . 3Then, it follows that the the correlation function of the random force is dependant upon the correlation function of the spacetime derivatives of the scalar field. Therefore, the observer moves from X = X(T ), which is given by the equation for the path, to∞. Correlation Function in Minkowski Spacetime: The correlation function is determined by taking the aver- age of product of the random force amplitudes at two different time-points T1 and T2.

Abstract: Identifying public misinformation is a complicated and challenging task. Animportant part of checking the veracity of a specific claim is to evaluate thestance different news sources take towards the assertion. Automatic stanceevaluation, i.e. stance detection, would arguably facilitate the process offact checking. In this paper, we present our stance detection system whichclaimed third place in Stage 1 of the Fake News Challenge. Despite ourstraightforward approach, our system performs at a competitive level with thecomplex ensembles of the top two winning teams. We therefore propose our systemas the 'simple but tough-to-beat baseline' for the Fake News Challenge stancedetection task.Comment: 6 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables; additional reference and details added,  typos and wording correcte

Automatic summary: Statistically averaged square of voltage 〈 U2 〉 is measured for different capacitances C. Boltzmann constant is determined by the equipartition theorem C 〈 U2 〉 = kBT . The purpose of the present work is to present a simple self- made set-up for determination of Boltzmann constant in high- school and student laboratories. The prob- lem of the floating of the zero is solved with large fast capac- itors sequentially connected to the gain resistors of the circuit depicted at Fig. Table of the calculated parameters necessary for the anal- ysis of the circuit (time constants, frequencies, voltages and lin- ear amplification). One can easily see the 2 dual ADA48986 operational amplifiers in a SOIC package, the 3 large WIMA capacitors,7 and the multiplier AD6334 in a PDIP package.

Summarization comparison for article: A General and Adaptive Robust Loss Function
Similarity: 0.109375
Abstract: We present a generalization of the Cauchy/Lorentzian, Geman-McClure,Welsch/Leclerc, generalized Charbonnier, Charbonnier/pseudo-Huber/L1-L2, and L2loss functions. By introducing robustness as a continous parameter, our lossfunction allows algorithms built around robust loss minimization to begeneralized, which improves performance on basic vision tasks such asregistration and clustering. Interpreting our loss as the negative log of aunivariate density yields a general probability distribution that includesnormal and Cauchy distributions as special cases. This probabilisticinterpretation enables the training of neural networks in which the robustnessof the loss automatically adapts itself during training, which improvesperformance on learning-based tasks such as generative image synthesis andunsupervised monocular depth estimation, without requiring any manual parametertuning
Automatic summary: Our loss is valid for all real values of α and for all real, positive values of c. The loss increases monotonically with the magnitude of x. In this paper we present a single loss function that is a superset of many of these com- mon loss functions. Loss Function With this analysis in place, we can present our final loss function. As as result, this loss may be useful to practitioners wishing to easily and continuously explore a wide variety of robust loss functions.

Abstract: In this paper, we use a sixth order Legendre series expansion to approximatethe mean annual insolation by latitude of a planet with obliquity angle$\beta$, leading to faster computations with little loss in the accuracy ofresults. We discuss differences between our method and selected computationalresults for insolation found in the literature.Comment: 5 pages, 2 figure
Automatic summary: The precession dependence for annual insolation averages out over the course of a year because of their assumption that precession is constant over this time period. In the following section we show how the method for section 2 compares with the results from two different computer programs designed to calculate insolation by latitude.

Summarization comparison for article: Diffusion-like recommendation with enhanced similarity of objects
Similarity: 0.14049586776859505
Abstract: In last decades, diversity and accuracy have been regarded as two importantmeasures in evaluating a recommendation model. However, a clear concern is thata model focusing excessively on one measure will put the other one at risk,thus it is not easy to greatly improve diversity and accuracy simultaneously.In this paper, we propose to enhance the Resource-Allocation (RA) similarity inresource transfer equations of diffusion-like models, by giving a tunableexponent to the RA similarity, and traversing the value of the exponent toachieve the optimal recommendation results. In this way, we can increase therecommendation scores (allocated resource) of many unpopular objects.Experiments on three benchmark data sets, MovieLens, Netflix, and RateYourMusicshow that the modified models can yield remarkable performance improvementcompared with the original ones
Automatic summary: A random recommendation will randomly choose L objects from the train set and recommend them to the target user, where L is the length of the recommendation list. The niche objects will receive lower final resources (recommendation scores) because they have fewer neighbor users (resource portals), thus rank in the bottom of the recommendation lists.

Abstract: Miloš Zeman won a second term as Czech President on 27 January, narrowly defeating opposition candidate Jiří Drahoš. Jan Rovny writes that the country is now sharply divided between two political blocs that cut across old left-right allegiances, with identity politics playing an increasingly important role in shaping support. The presidential election also underlined that Czech politics is likely to take another step closer to Poland and Hungary, but with the key distinction that the country’s liberal opposition has shown an ability to unite against Zeman and garner almost 50% of the vote

Summarization comparison for article: REVIEW SENYAWA ANTIBAKTERI PADA KOPI SANGRAI
Similarity: 0.0313588850174216
Abstract: Kopi sangrai merupakan salah satu bahan minuman yang telah diketahui potensinya sebagai antibakteri untuk menghambat ataupun membunuh bakteri. Kemampuan antibakteri ini diketahui efektif terhadap berbagai jenis bakteri patogen, seperti Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli dan Streptococcus mutans (bakteri yang diketahui tumbuh dalam mulut manusia). Aktivitas antibakteri ini dapat meningkat jika kopi disangrai dalam waktu yang lebih lama ataupun pada suhu yang lebih tinggi. Hal ini disebabkan adanya senyawa melanoidin dan alfa dikarbonil yang dihasilkan dalam reaksi Maillard selama proses penyangraian. Selain dari itu, aktivitas antibakteri juga didapati pada berbagai senyawa fenolik dan kafein yang ada pada kopi sangrai. Sehubungan dengan adanya berbagai senyawa antibakteri pada kopi sangrai, maka diperlukan review untuk merangkum publikasi yang telah diterbitkan mengenai berbagai senyawa antibakteri pada kopi sangrai. Hal tersebut menjadi tujuan penulis dalam menulis review. Berdasarkan berbagai jenis senyawa antibakteri pada kopi sangrai, diketahui bahwa salah satu isomer dari asam klorogenat (5-caffeoylquinic acid) memiliki potensi antibakteri yang lebih tinggi dari senyawa fenolik lainnya. Asam klorogenat mampu mengubah nilai pH pada membran bakteri. Senyawa trigonelline dan kafein didapati memiliki aktivitas antibakteri yang lemah terhadap sebagian besar dari bakteri patogen. Kafein ditemukan memiliki kemampuan untuk meningkatkan aktivitas antibakteri dari senyawa lain, seperti senyawa alfa dikarbonil. Senyawa alfa dikarbonil dan melanoidin telah dikenal memiliki aktivitas antibakteri yang tinggi. Hal ini dipengaruhi oleh rendahnya nilai pH pada senyawa alfa dikarbonil (1,92 untuk methylglyoxal; 2,10 untuk glyoxal) dan kemampuan melanoidin untuk mengikat kation yang menstabilkan membran bakteri. Selain dari itu, melanoidin juga diketahui dapat mengikat kation yang terkandung dalam media sehingga tidak dapat dikonsumsi oleh bakteri. Dalam aplikasinya terhadap bakteri patogen, kopi sangrai beserta dengan senyawa antibakterinya didapati lebih efektif terhadap bakteri gram positif dibandingkan bakteri gram negatif. Beberapa senyawa antibakteri diketahui memiliki efektifitas terhadap bakteri tertentu, seperti efektifitas dari senyawa melanoidin terhadap bakteri yang dapat membentuk suatu kompleks dengan zat besi sebagai perlindungan terhadap sel (siderophore). Senyawa trigonelline juga diketahui memiliki efektifitas terhadap bakteri yang diketahui tumbuh dalam mulut dan menyebabkan peradangan pada gusi manusia

Similarity: 0.045317220543806644
Abstract: Labu kuning (Cucurbita moschata) memiliki daging buah berwarna kuning menunjukkan adanya senyawa β-karoten sekitar 19,9 mg/100 g bahan. Salah satu cara untuk mendapatkan nilai tambah buah labu kuning, umumnya diolah menjadi tepung. Tepung labu kuning dapat disimpan lebih lama, selain itu lebih mudah dalam pengangkutan maupun pengemasan, serta lebih praktis untuk diolah. Kandungan gizi yang cukup lengkap membuat tepung labu kuning berpotensi untuk dimanfaatkan dalam berbagai produk olahan. Pie merupakan produk pastry yang memiliki ciri-ciri renyah dan rasanya yang khas. Pie sangat digemari oleh berbagai kalangan masyarakat sebagai makanan camilan. Kandungan tepung labu kuning yang ditambahkan pada pie diharapkan dapat menambah kebutuhan β-karoten yang diperlukan dalam tubuh. Tujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui pengaruh substitusi tepung labu kuning dalam pembuatan pie yang ditinjau berdasarkan karakteristik fisikokimiawi, tingkat kesukaan konsumen berdasarkan uji organoleptik, dan untuk mengetahui perubahan mikrobiologi selama penyimpanan. Penelitian pendahuluan dilakukan menggunakan uji organoleptik ranking hedonik untuk menyeleksi kulit pie dengan substitusi tepung labu kuning sebanyak 0%, 20%, 30%, dan 40%. Selanjutnya pada penelitian utama dilakukan pembuatan pie berdasarkan formulasi kulit pie terpilih yaitu substitusi tepung labu kuning sebanyak 0%, 20%, dan 30% yang kemudian ditambah filling puree labu kuning. Penelitian utama pie labu kuning dengan dilakukan pengujian terhadap analisa kimia (kadar air, abu, protein, lemak, karbohidrat, β – karoten, dan aktivitas antioksidan), analisa fisik (warna dan tekstur), analisa mikrobiologi, dan analisa organoleptik ranking hedonik. Hasil analisa kimia menunjukkan, semakin besar substitusi tepung labu kuning maka kadar air, kadar protein, dan kadar lemak semakin rendah, sedangkan kadar abu dan kadar karbohidrat semakin tinggi, selain itu kadar β-karoten trend nya berbanding lurus dengan peningkatan aktivitas antioksidan. Substitusi tepung labu kuning berpengaruh nyata terhadap karakteristik tekstur dan overall pie, namun tidak berpengaruh nyata terhadap warna, rasa dan aroma. Berdasarkan hasil penelitian didapatkan bahwa semakin besar konsentrasi substitusi tepung labu kuning maka nilai warna akan semakin kuning dan gelap, sedangkan nilai hardness semakin meningkat. Pada analisa mikrobiologi, jumlah kapang meningkat yang mengindikasikan bahwa pie pada penyimpanan hari ke-2 dapat dikatakan sudah tidak layak untuk dikonsumsi

Abstract: Di era yang serba modern ini, sebagian besar orang tidak luput dari penggunaan teknologi dalam menjalankan aktifitasnya. Dengan dibantu oleh teknologi maka pekerjaan dapat diselesaikan jauh lebih cepat dibanding tanpa menggunakan bantuan teknologi. Perkembangan teknologi sendiri diharapkan dapat mempermudah para pelaku usaha dalam menjalankan usahanya. Salah satu contoh dari teknologi tersebut yaitu teknologi informasi akuntansi berbasis komputer. Teknologi informasi akuntansi berbasis komputer berguna untuk mempermudah proses pengumpulan, pengolahan, menyusun, menyimpan dan memanipulasi data untuk menghasilkan informasi yang relevan, akurat dan tepat waktu. Dalam menjalankan bisnisnya, para pelaku bisnis juga membutuhkan penerapan teknologi informasi akuntansi berbasis komputer pada bisnisnya supaya proses bisnis berjalan lebih efektif dan efisien. Penelitian ini dilakukan di Pabrik Tahu Siliwangi yang dalam menjalankan kegiatan usahanya belum menggunakan sistem teknologi informasi akuntansi, melainkan masih menggunakan sistem pencatatan secara manual. Oleh karena itu, penulis melakukan analisis dan juga merancang sistem informasi akuntansi berbasis teknologi informasi akuntansi pada tempat usaha tersebut dengan menggunakan metode Model Driven Development (MDD). Tahapan yang dilakukan dalam proses perancangan sistem meliputi; tahap identifikasi masalah, analisis masalah, analisis kebutuhan sistem dan yang terakhir adalah tahap desain (desain data, desain proses dan desain interface). Pada tahap desain data akan dibuat Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). Pada tahap desain proses akan dilakukan pengolahan data dari input menjadi output berupa Data Flow Diagram (DFD). Pada tahap desain interface akan dibuat sistem desain tampilan awal program, baik input maupun output

Summarization comparison for article: Radiocarbon dating of mortar: Case study of the Aqueduct in Skopje
Similarity: 0.05454545454545454
Abstract: Dating of mortar has been a challenge since the early days of the radiocarbon dating method. The idea is to date only the carbon fixed in mortar at the time of binding (i.e., the binder). However, results of ¹⁴C mortar dating are often compromised with dead carbon contamination originating from unreacted limestone during preparation of quick lime. Also, non-binder carbon can be incorporated into mortar sample (1) due to precipitation of secondary carbonates from environment, (2) in case of fire accidents, it is replaced with the carbon from the atmosphere at the time of accident, or (3) if the mortar is too alkaline, it still incorporates carbon from the atmosphere. Therefore, an effort is placed into developing of a method that can isolate strictly the binder carbon, with the help of the accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) measurement technique enabling analyses of various phases of mortar. However, no reliable procedure has yet been established for each mortar type (Hajdas et al., 2017). The Zagreb Radiocarbon Laboratory was approached with a request to determinate time of the Aqueduct in Skopje (FYR Macedonia) construction through ¹⁴C dating of mortar samples. The Aqueduct is one of the landmarks of Skopje, a monumental building more than 385 m long. It was a part of a water-supply system with a total length of about 10 km. The age of the Aqueduct is not known – several hypotheses place it to periods between 6th and 16th century. Six mortar samples from different positions of the eastern façade and the upper parts with remains of tubes were collected in July 2017, paying attention that samples were not deteriorated and were situated at higher levels with less possibility of containing the secondary carbon. In the Laboratory, the maximum 5 cm of the mortar from the surface was subsampled, than broken by alternately changing temperatures from -198 °C to 80 °C. In order to extract only the carbon from the binder three strategies for separation of binder carbon were used: 1) mechanical separation of calcite inclusions formed during mortar hardening (not possible for all mortars), 2) selection on the basis of particle size and the ability to suspend in water induced by ultrasonic shock, and 3) collection of at least two fractions of CO₂ produced by reaction of calcite with acid. With the premise that all mortars originated from the same era, the results of ¹⁴C dating of each fraction were combined to yield a plausible date of the Aqueduct building. Some results were eliminated due to very low δ¹³C values combined with modern ¹⁴C dates and some implied dead carbon contamination. The most reliable results were obtained from two inclusions and one suspended fraction placing the time of the Aqueduct construction in 15-16 century AD. The analyses will be presented and possibility of using the method for future mortar dating will be discussed. References Hajdas et al. 2017.

Abstract: The RadiÖko Ltd. radioanalytical laboratory and Laboratory for low-level radioactivities of the Ruđer Bošković Institute (RBI) performed an interlaboratory comparison for the determination of H-3 and C-14 activities in water samples. Three samples were measured for H-3, two for C-14 activity. Each laboratory applied their own sample preparation techniques for H-3 determination and the activities were measured by LSC Quantulus 1220. At the RBI the low H-3 activity sample A was measured by both direct and electrolytic enrichment method. For the determination of the radiocarbon activity the Zagreb laboratory used AMS technique, whilst RadiÖko used an own developed sample oxizer followed by LSC measurement using a Quantulus LSC. It is interesting to note that all three H-3 results of the RadiÖko group are lower than those obtained at RBI. The results of the two radiocarbon measurements reveal that in the case of sample D the measurement results of the laboratories lie close to each other. Sample E had too high activity to be determined by AMS technique, this way it is not possible to compare the results. In all the successfully conducted cases it is apparent that the differences are well below the 10% satisfactory range

Summarization comparison for article: The labor supply of baby-boomers and low-flation
Similarity: 0.296969696969697
Abstract: Why is wage inflation so weak in spite of the recent sharp reduction in unemployment? We show that this may be due to an ongoing major positive labor supply shock. Indeed, the participation rate of workers aged between 55 and 64 has increased steadily over the last decade, from a third to above a half on average across OECD countries. This is most likely the consequence of aging and the reform of pensions. We show that the participation rate of workers aged 55 to 64 contributes to explain why wage inflation has remained weak over the last five years. For instance, it accounts for as much as -1% of wage inflation per annum in Germany since 2013. Our second result is that Phillips curves are alive and well. Wage inflation remains highly responsive to domestic unemployment rates, including after the Great Recession
Automatic summary: The participation rates of the elderly have a significant negative effect on wage inflation for G7 countries, in the euro area and more broadly in the OECD. We show that the participation rate of workers aged 55 to 64 contributes to explain why wage inflation has remained weak over the last five years. As shown in the first column, wage inflation is highly responsive to its three traditional determinants: lagged CPI inflation, productivity and the unemployment rate. Rate differential above 55 - below 55 P. Rate differential above 55 - below 55 dP. What is less known, at least to inflation analysts, it that it has led to a tremendous increase in the participation of older workers to the labor market2. 6 standard backward looking wage Phillips curve (in the top panel) and the one augmented with the participation rate of workers ages 55 to 64 (in the bottom panel). Ceteris paribus, this positive labor supply shock is likely to push down wage inflation and unit labor costs. A one percent drop in the unemployment rate increases wage inflation by 0.5‐0.6% on average in the G7, 0.4% for the OECD and 0.25% in the euro area.

Abstract: Background: As a rare tumor, yolk sac tumor is a type of neoplasm that appears like the yolk sac, extraembryonic mesenchyme, and allantois. The mediastinum is the second most frequent area after the gonadal area. Case report: We present an extremely rare case of 15 years old boy with mediastinal yolk sac tumor. The boy came with the chief complaint of swelling of the neck and face. Computed tomography scan of the chest revealed bulky mass with a cystic component that infiltrated the heart. The diagnosis of mediastinal yolk sac tumor was made after core needle biopsy. Histopathologic analysis revealed tumor mass with solid and microcystic structure and pleomorphic nucleus within the tumor cells. Laboratory finding showed elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein level reaching more than 8000 ng/ml. Echocardiography revealed a mass in the right atrium. The patient condition was rapidly deteriorated due to his vena cava superior syndrome. Unfortunately, the patient died two days after diagnosis and we did not have the chance to do the therapy. Conclusion: Mediastinal yolk sac tumor is a rare malignancy that requires comprehensive management. The diagnosis should be made based on histopathological findings with the addition of thoracic computer tomography scan to assess the degree of infiltration to surrounding organ. A life-threatening condition such as vena cava superior syndrome should be assessed promptly to allow for immediate treatment
Automatic summary: Our patient came with superior vena cava syn- drome so we performed radiotherapy to the tumor location to release compression of the tumor to the superior vena cava. However, the prognosis of primary mediastinal yolk sac tumor is poor and further research is needed to find the best treatment modality and regi- men for the tumor. In conclusion, primary mediastinal yolk sac tumor is an aggressive tumor that often invades and infiltrates surrounding structures and metastasis. Case report: We present an extremely rare case of 15 years old boy with mediastinal yolk sac tumor. Complete histologic response to chemotherapy in a patient with a mediastinal yolk sac tumor: a case report. Yolk sac tumor is nonseminomatous malignant GCTs that resembles yolk sac and extraembryonic mesenchyme . However, rare cases of mediastinal yolk sac tumor in 2 years old girl and 66 years old women were also reported [8, 9]. Primary mediastinal yolk sac tumor is classified as poor prognosis by the International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG) with the 5-year survival of 50% . Core needle biopsy was performed and diagnosis of mediastinal yolk sac tumor was made based on the histopathological finding. DISCUSSION We presented a case of yolk sac tumor in the anterior mediastinum of a 15 years old boy. Histopathologic analysis revealed tumor mass with solid and microcystic structure and pleomorphic nucleus within the tumor cells. The mediastinal yolk sac tumor diagnosis was made after we performed core needle biopsy. Uchiyama M, Iwafuchi M, Matsuda Y.

Abstract: Erwinia amylovora, a bacterial blight affecting fruit, is one of the most known and dangerous diseases affecting quince, pear and apple and other Rosaceae family plants. It was first discovered in America in 1780, and first appeared in Macedonian quinces in 1989. Erwinia amylovora, called bacterial blight of fruit trees and ornamental plants, is one of the most intensely pathogenic bacteria that have been studied. It is assumed that the disease was first recognised in the United States at the end of the 18th century in wild species of plants, from which the bacteria spread to sensitive varieties of pear (Pyrus communis), apple (Malus silvestris) and quince (Cydonia oblongata), introduced by early American settlers from Eastern Europe and Southwest Asia. Drying of fruit trees was first observed in mountainous areas on both sides of the Hudson River in New York. From this region, the bacteria spread at high speed to neighbouring countries
Automatic summary: Erwinia amylovora, called bacterial blight of fruit trees and ornamental plants, is one of the most intensely pathogenic bacteria that have been studied. 7 Erwinia amylovora - bacterial blight of quince, pears and apples Quince (Cydonia oblonga) belongs to the genus Cydonia, subfamily Pomoidae and family Rosaceae. The bacterial blight disease is the most harmful for pears, apples, quince and other plants of the family Rosaceae. In Mexico, the disease was first reported in 1921, and in 1943 was observed in pear and apple trees (Bonn & Van der Zwet, 2000). The first is the ability of bacteria to multiply on the surface of plants without causing disease (Thomson, 2000).  , bacterial blight on apple, pear and quince 7 2.

Abstract: The length of stay of healthy term newborn should be based on the unique characteristics of each mother/infant dyad, including health and stability of the mother/infant, and the confidence of the mother to care for her infant. The length of hospital stays following normal term delivery has decreased dramatically over the past few decades and early discharge is considered shorter than 48 hours after birth.  The aim of this study was to assess the dyad mother/baby before the discharge in order to reduce the risks of adverse events including neonatal readmission rates, neonatal mortality rates and emergency room visits.  Material and methods: CUSCWBEM score (acronym for color, urine, stool, color, weight, breasts and maternal emotions) was performed after obtaining informed consent from the mother. 148 pairs mother/baby from the University Clinic for Gynecology and Obstetrics in Skopje, Macedonia, were examined using CUSCWBEM score forms, containing 10 items, on the second day, while both, mother and baby were settled well.. As affirmative for discharge was a score of 8 and more points.  Results: 106 pairs mother/baby passed the assessment and considered prepared for discharge (it is 71,6%). Those who have failed the assessment mainly was for mild cyanosis (2%), jaundice (6,1%), unsatisfactory weight (2,5%), breast problems in mother (3,1%), maternal emotions, low bonding and unpreparedness (5%) and the rest had combination of two and more indicators. Those pairs were not considered for discharge in 48 hours.  Conclusion: bonding is a vital component of the attachment process as a measure for prevention of physical, emotional and social impairments through the life course. Other elements of the wellbeing are essential as well. Therefore, thorough postpartum assessment is key measure in prevention of adverse events after the early discharge, as this model was proven effective for the transition and cost-effective for the health system.  \u

Similarity: 0.2553191489361702
Abstract: Procurement of materials and spare parts for the needs of the companies is often a major source of problems for the quality of products and services. This paper shows the results of a larger study of Macedonian companies in terms of planning and implementing the philosophy of Total Quality Management (TQM) and building partnerships with suppliers. The survey results indicate the fact that many of the companies in Macedonia build formal relationship with suppliers that do not deliver the desired results. When there is poor quality of the raw materials, good quality of product is not expected, therefore consistency on the market is not achieved and the requirements of ISO standards are not met. To achieve sustainable development, Macedonian companies need to eliminate old habits and proactively focus on developing long-term partnerships with suppliers, providing technical support for training to improve processes, product quality, productivity, in one word accepting the TQM philosophy.\u
Automatic summary: Quality of the products depends on the quality of raw materials provided by the supplier, therefore building a partnership with the supplier is necessary. QUALITY MANAGEMENT 45 only formal business relationships with suppliers without willing to essentially improve these relations or to define the obligations and responsibilities and to improve the quality. Actions such as timely delivery of raw materials without defects can greatly improve the quality of the products as “first step” to provide good quality of products and services. Suppliers are key link in the planning and implementation of TQM (Total Quality Management) system and they play an important role for effective and efficient quality system. The Supplier Relationship Management in Macedonian companies Management of suppliers is an important aspect of the quality system.

Abstract: Attachment of mothers and child started from the infancy and became essential in the process of growth and development of the children, especially the socio-emotional development. To make a strong emotional attachment between the mother and her baby, the mother must always respond to every child's needs. However, today phenomenon is that the mothers are busy with her activities and depend on the babysitter. The purpose of this research is to identify the correlation between mothers and child attachment to the socio-emotional development of infant in Community Health Center of Darul Imarah in Aceh Besar Regency. The type of this research is descriptive correlative with a cross-sectional study approach. The respondents of this research are 86 mothers who have 1-12 month age infant and were chosen using proportional random sampling. The data collection was conducted on 5 villages from 32 villages in the work area of Community Health Center of Darul Imarah in Aceh Besar Regency. The data collection is using a questionnaire to identify the mothers and child attachment and questionnaire of ASQ:SE-2 of 2 month age, 6 month and 12 month to identify the socio-emotional development of the baby. The result of the research with chi-square analysis shows that there is a correlation between attachment of mothers and child on the socio-development of the baby in Community Health Center of Darul Imarah in Aceh Besar Regency (p-value=0.003).

Similarity: 0.546875
Abstract: Purpose: to demonstrate 1H-MR spectroscopy of the frontal region in patients with metabolic syndrome and to correlate the metabolic ratios with anthropometric measurement. Material and methods: A prospective study was conducted upon 20 patients with metabolic syndrome (10 male, 10 female; mean age 52 years) and 20 age- and sex-matched volunteers. Patients were mild-moderate (n = 14) and marked and morbid obesity (n = 6). Patients and volunteers underwent 1H-MR spectroscopy of the frontal region. The Ch/Cr and NAA/Cr ratio were calculated and correlated with anthropometric measurement. Results: The Cho/Cr and NAA/Cr of patients with Mets (1.03 ± 0.08 and 1.62 ± 0.08) were significantly different (p = 0.001) to those of volunteers (0.78 ± 0 and 1.71 ± 0.61, respectively). The Cho/Cr and NAA/Cr cutoffs used to differentiate patients from volunteers were 0.89 and 1.77 with areas under the curve of 0.992 and 0.867 and accuracy of 97% and 93%, respectively. There was a significant difference in Cho/Cr and NAA/Cr between patients with marked-morbid obesity and moderate-mild obesity (p = 0.001 respectively). Conclusions: We concluded that NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr ratios of the frontal region can differentiate patients with metabolic syndrome from volunteers and are well correlated with the anthropometric measurement

Summarization comparison for article: Cerebral arteriovenous malformations : usability of Spetzler-Martin and Spetzler-Ponce scales in qualification to endovascular embolisation and neurosurgical procedure
Similarity: 0.34309623430962344
Abstract: Purpose: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are connected with cerebral haemorrhage, seizures, increased intracranial pressure, headaches, mass effect, and ischaemia symptoms. Selection of the best treatment method or even deciding if intervention is required can be difficult. Material and methods: The study included 50 patients who were diagnosed with cerebral AVMs and treated in our Centre between 2008 and 2014. A total of 111 procedures were performed, including 94 endovascular embolisations and 17 neurosurgical procedures. Medical records and imaging data were reviewed for all patients. All AVMs were measured and assessed, allowing classification in Spetzler-Martin and Spetzler-Ponce scales. Results: Complete or partial treatment was observed in 88.24% of neurosurgical procedures and in 84.00% of embolisations. Early complication rate was 21.28% for embolisation and 17.65% for neurosurgical procedures, while Glasgow Outcome Scale was 4.89 (σ = 0.38) and 5.0 (σ = 0.00), respectively. According to the Spetzler-Martin scale, cerebral haemorrhages occurred more frequently in grade 1, but no statistical significance was observed. In Spetzler- Ponce class B lower grades in Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) were noticed (p = 0.02). Lower GCS scores were also correlated with deep location of AVM and with eloquence of adjacent brain. Patients with Spetzler-Martin grade 1 were more frequently qualified for neurosurgical procedures than other patients. Conclusions: Treating AVMs requires coordination of a multidisciplinary team. Both endovascular embolisation and neurosurgical procedure should be considered as a part of multimodal, frequently multistage treatment. Spetzler-Martin and Spetzler-Ponce scales have an influence on haemorrhage frequency and patients’ clinical condition and should be taken into consideration in selecting the treatment method

A proposed grading system for endovascular treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations: Buffalo score. If the patients had not been qual- ified to invasive treatment in our Centre, conservative treatment was implemented or the patient was referred to radiosurgery in other centres. Both endovascular embolisation and neurosurgical procedure should be considered as a part of multimodal, frequently multistage treatment. Sixty-five procedures (69.15%) led to complete embolisation of one feeding vessel, fulfilling the aim of the procedure, as a part of multistage treatment. Both endovascular embolisation and neuro- surgical procedure should be considered as part of multi- modal, frequently multistage treatment.

Similarity: 0.3502824858757062
Abstract: Papillary cystadenoma of the epididymis (PCE) is the second most common benign neoplasm of the epididymis [1]. It is very uncommon and has never been reported in a prepubertal male. It may occur sporadically, but more often occurs in association with von Hippel- Lindau (VHL) disease [2]. There have been over 60 reports of patients with such tumors, with the youngest patient being 16 years old. We present the case of a 12- year old male with a history of stage IV neuroblastoma. He presented with a left paratesticular mass that was discovered on routine follow up physical exam with his pediatric oncologist. He was asymptomatic at the time of presentation with no signs or symptoms of hypoandrogenism. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis was negative for lymphadenopathy and additional disease sites. Given the patient's history of stage IV neuroblastoma, there was suspicion of yolk sac tumor or metastases; he underwent an open radical left orchiectomy. Frozen section was consistent with yolk sac tumor, however final pathology revealed normal testicle with PCE. To date, this patient is the youngest reported patient with this diagnosis; furthermore papillary cystadenoma of the epididymis has never been reported in a patient with neuroblastoma

Summarization comparison for article: Pain rewarded: hyperalgesic and allodynic effect of operant conditioning in healthy humans : protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis
Similarity: 0.34375
Abstract: Background: "pain rewarded" is a hypothesis wherein acute pain sufferers are exposed to reinforcers and punishers from their environment that shape their behaviour, i.e. pain responses. Such a point of view has been taken for granted by many clinicians and researchers although existing evidence has not yet been systematically summarized. This planned systematic review and meta-analysis is aiming to summarize the research findings on pain modulation (hyperalgesic effect) and pain elicitation (allodynic effect) resulting from operant conditioning procedures in healthy humans. Methods: the systematic review will be performed by searching for articles indexed in PubMed database, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (Central), Web of Science™, ScienceDirect, Ebsco database, PsycInfo, Medline, PsycArticles and cinahl. Studies will be included if they investigate healthy humans, exposed to modulation or elicitation of a pain experience induced by operant conditioning. Studies will be screened for eligibility and risk of bias by two independent assessors. Narrative and meta-analytical syntheses are planned. Discussion: data will be pooled and analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively (if possible) in order to advance the understanding of pain mechanisms, especially the development of chronic pain. This systematic review will guide the planning of future experiments and research by summarizing important technical details of conditioning procedures in healthy humans

Summarization comparison for article: Near ultraviolet light emitting diode composed of n-GaN/ZnO coaxial nanorod heterostructures on a p-GaN layer
Similarity: 0.39823008849557523
Abstract: The authors report on the fabrication and characteristics of near ultraviolet nanorod light emitting diodes (LEDs) composed of n-GaN/ZnO nanorod heterostructures on p-GaN substrates. The nanorod LEDs consist of the vertically aligned n-GaN/ZnO coaxial nanorod arrays grown on a p-GaN substrate. The LEDs demonstrated strong near ultraviolet emission at room temperature. The nanorod LEDs were turned on a forward-bias voltage of 5 V, and exhibited a large light emitting area. From electroluminescent spectra, dominant emission peaks were observed at 2.96 and 3.24 eV for an applied current of 2 mA. The origins of the strong and large area light emission are also discussed in terms of enhanced carrier injection from n-GaN nanostructures to p-GaN substrates.open1414

Summarization comparison for article: Assessment of the NEK5000 code for Direct Numerical Simulations
Similarity: 0.2546583850931677
Abstract: The present work is included in the frame of the fundamental studies performed worldwide aiming at improving the prediction tools for investigating turbulence phenomena, in order to provide the basis for the assessment of codes and models suitable for the detailed analysis of complex fluid systems, like nuclear reactors.A critical aspect of the nuclear reactor safety is the fluid-structure interaction, and in particular, the combined effect of a turbulent flow with a thermal mixing, which may lead to local Thermal Fatigue phenomena into the structures due to Thermal Striping.The main goal of the present work is to assess the DNS capabilities of the spectral elements code NEK5000 for the fundamental turbulent flows and their thermal interaction with solid structures. This work is divided into two parts.In the first part, DNS computations are carried out in order to evaluate the performances of the code in predicting the turbulent flow behaviour for simplistic channel flow configurations.Whereas, in the second part, the DNS analyses are further extended for a conjugate heat transfer case, i.e. a planer channel flow along with heated walls. Three different temperature fields are considered.A wide range of numerical parameters are tested and their influence is studied in order to obtain high quality turbulence statistics both for the velocity and the thermal fields. The obtained results are compared against other well-known DNS databases available in literature. The comparison suggests that NEK5000 exhibits excellent capabilities to perform high quality DNS computations

Summarization comparison for article: Internet of Things for Dementia Care
Similarity: 0.15934065934065933
Abstract: In this paper we discuss a technical design and an ongoing trial that is being conducted in the UK, called Technology Integrated Health Management (TIHM). TIHM uses Internet of Things (IoT) enabled solutions provided by various companies in a collaborative project. The IoT devices and solutions are integrated in a common platform that supports interoperable and open standards. A set of machine learning and data analytics algorithms generate notifications regarding the well-being of the patients. The information is monitored around the clock by a group of healthcare practitioners who take appropriate decisions according to the collected data and generated notifications. In this paper we discuss the design principles and the lessons that we have learned by co-designing this system with patients, their carers, clinicians, and also our industry partners. We discuss the technical design of TIHM and explain why user-centred and human-experience should be an integral part of the technological design
Automatic summary: To initiate the data analysis, the integrated data were first validated to comply with the FHIR4TIHM data model and then stored in the Mongo database. These data are then validated 2The clinical monitoring team is responsible for continuous monitoring of the available data and generated alerts. With data consistency in mind across data publishers, val- idation of the incoming data must be strict. To allow the integration of these data, a common data model has been specifically defined for this project, see next section. The data analytics algorithms aim to provide early indication of patients’ needs allowing the clinical team to provide a timely response and prevent escalating ill health. DATA GOVERNANCE AND ANALYSIS Generally, real-world data should undergo pre-processing, analysis, and interpretation to provide meaningful information and actionable knowledge. To this end, a JSON validator (schema) has been prepared according to the agreed data model and set up on the central TIHM backend to validate the incoming data.

Summarization comparison for article: Utilizing a Meso Scale Limited Dome Test to Study the Effect of Strain Rate on the Formability of Commercial Pure Titanium Grade Two Foil
Similarity: 0.3484848484848485
Abstract: Due to its hexagonal close-packed (HCP) crystal structures and limited slipping systems, commercial pure titanium (CP Ti) has a relatively low ductility at room temperature. In order to understand the effect of strain rate on formability of the as-received tempered CP Ti grade 2 foils with thickness of 38µm, a series of meso-limited dome height (meso-LDH) tests were designed and conducted at three punch speeds (0.01mm/sec, 12m/sec and 17m/sec) without lubricant at room temperature. The forming limit curves of the foil at three different punch speeds were obtained, and can be used right away for product design, process design and development, die design, and simulations etc. As discovered in this experimental study, the reasons why increasing strain rate can improve the formability are: n value increases with increasing strain rate, the temperature of part increases rapidly due to adiabatic effect, and the negative influence of friction can be reduced
Automatic summary: As discovered in their study, the strain rate had a considerable effect on stress flow, strain hardening, and fracture elongation, which increase with increasing strain rate. Three forming limit curves for 3 different strain rates (punch speeds) were obtained, that can be used for industries for die design, process design and simulation, product design, etc. The negative influence of friction on formability of CP Ti foils can be reduced proportionally with increasing punch speed (strain rate). However, with the increasing of forming speed, not only does the major strain go higher, but also the minor strain become larger.
