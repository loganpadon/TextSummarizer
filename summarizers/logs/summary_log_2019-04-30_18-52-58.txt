Title: Making family: the journey into exile of a South Sudan refugee - part 2 #LSEreturn
Word count: 1695
Abstract: Through the story of Chol, LSE’s Naomi Pendle explores the meaning of exile and the lived experience of being a refugee through cycles of displacement and return. In the first article of this two-part series, Pendle tells us how Chol rebuilt home after years spent in exile. Now, LSE’s Naomi Pendle narrates Chol’s return into exile, a journey that was in itself a return and cemented his ability to build a family

basic summary: Now, LSE’s Naomi Pendle narrates Chol’s return into exile, a journey that was in itself a return and cemented his ability to build a family. It was these networks, as much as a journey to a safe space, that he sought to cement as safety for himself, his wife and his son. Yet, they knew that the journey would be fraught with dangers and force them to weave between government and rebel held territories.

sim_matrix summary: Safety for Chol was the return to northern Sudan and the familiar values of business. He feared others would advise against this journey as people had already tried to reach Khartoum and not all had been safe. Yet, they knew that the journey would be fraught with dangers and force them to weave between government and rebel held territories.

Title: Young people are highly critical of Brexit and fear the insularity it could bring
Word count: 1070
Abstract: Most young people did not support Brexit and the referendum result left many feeling frustrated and disempowered, write Shakuntala Banaji and Sam Mejias (LSE). They fear the vote will make the UK more insular and are highly critical of the way the campaign was conducted. In focus groups, they showed a strong understanding of the EU – and want a Brexit settlement that tackles inequality as well as ensuring Britain is an open and welcoming country
basic similarity: 0.32409041521935816
basic summary: A minority of respondents asserted that the referendum and subsequent events had been a ‘participation catalyst’ for young people to become more politically active. As soon as people voted leave, there were attacks on minorities…I don’t know [if] people thought it was more OK to be racist, because they were leaving [the EU]. Secondly, young people expressed dissatisfaction that the oldest generations (65+) should have such a disproportionate influence on the futures of the youngest citizens.

sim_matrix summary: With no funding, but assisted by a fantastic group of youth partners (including youth participation NGO My Life My Say and the All Party Parliamentary Group on a Better Brexit for Young People) we set up a series of focus groups across the UK to find out what young people from 13 to 30 think and feel about Brexit, and what they want out of the Brexit process. (Youth participant from Falkirk & Clackmannanshire, Scotland) Priorities and hopes It will come as no surprise then that a majority of young people in our study were adamant that they want the post- Brexit UK to be a better place than the UK is now, that they want negotiations to retain the rights and benefits associated with Europe today – freedom of movement, human and civil rights protections, subsidies, the single market – while also tackling inequality that has risen due to austerity. Although these were complex, and not a simple matter of the young ‘blaming’ everyone older than them, we were told of two levels of resentment: in the first case, young people under 18 felt deprived of a voice and overwhelmingly said that if they could, they would have voted to remain.

Title: The political significance of Poland's government reshuffle
Word count: 1984
Abstract: A sweeping reshuffle by Poland's new prime minister has changed the shape and direction of its government, with a greater emphasis being placed on economic modernisation, political stabilisation and improving EU relations. But as Aleks Szczerbiak writes, this pivot to the technocratic centre risks alienating the ruling party's core electorate, and is more about packaging the government's reforms attractively than abandoning its its radical state re-construction programme

text_rank summary: Indeed, some commentators have suggested that the reshuffle may be part of a more ambitious, long-term project of transforming Law and Justice into a pragmatic conservative grouping; although others dismiss it as simply a tactical pivot similar to the one that the party performed so successfully in the run-up to the 2015 elections.Beata Szydło’s administration took the political flak for introducing these reforms but, with the passage of the judicial reform laws at the end of last year, many of the key elements of the government’s state re-construction programme are now in place.

Political stabilisation and improving EU relations One of the reshuffle’s main objectives was to stabilise and consolidate Law and Justice’s position ahead of a series of key elections: local government elections in autumn 2018, European Parliament elections in summer 2019, and parliamentary elections in autumn 2019, culminating in the summer 2020 presidential poll.

Title: What the 2015 Greek debt negotiations tell us about Germany's negotiating stance on Brexit
Word count: 1401
Abstract: If the UK wants to secure favourable terms during the Brexit negotiations, it will be crucial to win the support of Germany. But what are the key German priorities as the talks move on to the second phase? Luuk Molthof writes that the 2015 Greek debt negotiations offer some insights into the German approach, and that the UK is likely to be disappointed if it believes Germany will put economic interests above its political support for European integration
basic similarity: 0.46739467262411993
basic summary: To understand why the British government would do well to heed these warnings, it is useful to be reminded of Germany’s role in the 2015 Greek bailout negotiations. The reason why Germany ultimately agreed to another bailout was because a Greek exit from the eurozone would undermine the euro’s credibility as an instrument of political integration. Yet in order to protect the euro’s role as a political instrument, Germany was willing to bear the economic costs.

Similarly, Germany is likely to be willing to bear the economic costs of a no deal Brexit should that be necessary to protect the integrity of the internal market.

The British government faces a similar suboptimal outcome should it fail to come to the realisation soon that it is indeed the junior negotiating partner, that time is really not on its side, and that empty threats to walk away from the negotiations without a deal aren’t likely to change anyone’s mind, least of all Germany’s.

text_rank similarity: 0.31522305146551355
text_rank summary: Assuming the VFL bill makes it beyond the second reading, we can expect any subsequent parliamentary debate to be highly politicised: opposition parties see VFL not as a progressive move to end the disenfranchisement of potentially millions of its citizens living outside the UK, but as a cynical ploy to increase Tory votes and donations (individuals can only donate if they are on an electoral register).This is further corroborated by the simultaneous statement from the Chair of ‘Conservatives Abroad’, Heather Harper, who welcomed the government’s renewed commitment to VFL: “The second reading of [the Overseas Electors Bill] brings us closer to getting votes for life for all British expatriates”.Certain campaigners have suggested that the creation of dedicated ‘overseas’ constituencies, such as those created by France, Italy, and Portugal, would avoid the problems of establishing proof of previous registration or residence, and would give expats better representation.

Title: Quantity does matter as citation impact increases with productivity
Word count: 1040
Abstract: Many scholars are encouraged to focus on the quality not the quantity of their publications, the rationale being that becoming too focused on productivity risks reducing the quality of one's work. But is this, in fact, the case? Peter van den Besselaar and Ulf Sandström have studied a large sample of researchers and found that, while results vary by field, there is a positive and stronger than linear relationship between productivity and quality (in terms of the top cited papers). This same pattern appears to apply to institutions as well as individual researchers

In the social sciences, the (slightly) “diminishing returns” pattern seems to dominate; whereas the “impact ceiling” pattern was found for computer science & mathematics and for the humanities. Higher numbers of papers do result in even higher numbers of top cited papers.

sim_matrix summary: Figure 1 shows the various possible relationships between “quality” and “quantity” that may exist: (i) there may be an “impact ceiling”, meaning that after a certain number of papers the number of highly cited papers stabilises; there could be (ii) diminishing; (iii) constant; or even (iv) increasing “impact returns” from productivity; and finally (v) “small may be beautiful” in the sense that the number of high-impact papers decreases when authors become too productive, trading quality for quantity. Our understanding, developed in a recent PLoS ONE paper, is that there is a positive and stronger than linear relationship between productivity and quality (in terms of the top cited papers). We tested this using the Leiden Ranking 2014, which details the number of papers and the number of papers belonging to the top 10% highly cited papers for all universities included. This size effect also holds at organisational level, something we did not address in the PLoS ONE paper but tested after a reviewer claimed the opposite: “the CWTS Leiden Ranking, for example, does not show such a linear relationship as the authors claim between the number of papers produced by a university and the percentage of highly cited papers produced by that university”.

Title: Far right politics in Germany: from fascism to populism?
Word count: 1606
Abstract: The rise of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) was one of the major stories of the 2017 German elections. As Tomá\v Nociar and Jan Philipp Thomeczek write, there has been a tendency among some commentators to draw parallels between the AfD and extremist or fascist parties from Germany's past. They argue that this is both unhelpful and inaccurate, and that the AfD has far more in common with other ‘populist’ parties who have had success in recent European elections

Title: LSE festival Beveridge 2.0 preview: 'why we need a citizen's basic income: a new edition or a new book?' by Malcolm Torry
Word count: 1430
Abstract: On Tuesday 20 February 2018, LSE hosted a ‘Citizen’s Basic Income Day’, including the LSE Festival evening event, ‘Beveridge Rebooted: A Basic Income for Every Citizen?’: listen to the podcast here. Ahead of the discussion, panellist Dr Malcolm Torry discusses his forthcoming new book on the topic, Why We Need a Citizen’s Basic Income, and how it builds on his previous works, including Money for Everyone: Why We Need a Citizen’s Income
basic similarity: 0.19469162526389894
basic summary: Everyone of the same age would receive the same amount, every week or every month, no matter what their income, wealth, employment status, household structure, etc. We decided to put detailed research results in an online appendix because we believed that the figures would go out of date much faster than the book.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.4298109532849054
sim_matrix summary: A Citizen’s Basic Income (sometimes called a Basic Income, a Citizen’s Income or a Universal Basic Income) is an unconditional and nonwithdrawable income for every individual. The final two chapters were about alternatives to Citizen’s Basic Income, and about the social problems that a Citizen’s Basic Income would not solve.

text_rank summary: A brief flurry of activity 35 years ago prompted a small group of us to form the Basic Income Research Group – now the Citizen’s Basic Income Trust – and then the Basic Income European Network (BIEN: now the Basic Income Earth Network) to promote research and debate, so that the idea wouldn’t disappear entirely, and so that the next time there was an upswing in interest, there would be expertise and literature available to facilitate an intelligent discussion.By 2016 the question ‘would a Citizen’s Basic Income be a good idea?’ was still being asked, but two other questions were if anything more prominent: would a Citizen’s Basic Income be feasible?

Title: Who is helped by Help to Buy?
Word count: 1831
Abstract: What's not to like about a policy which can expand home ownership and boost the supply of housing? Geoff Meeks and J.Gay Meeks recount some of the doubts about the efficacy of the government's Help to Buy scheme. They present new evidence on some of its regressive distributional consequences, and touch on the opportunity cost of the subsidy programme
basic similarity: 0.407356173557794
basic summary: These are “equity loans”, which means the government’s stake in a participating house changes at the same rate with the value of the house. As house prices rise, the argument goes, the government achieves capital gains, which offset the interest costs of servicing the debt which funds H2B. So the new house will be much the better buy, and it will be worth her while to pay more for the new than for the second- hand house.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.42080610435706217
sim_matrix summary: One consequence of the H2B subsidy further stoking the inflation of house prices is that the initial aim of the scheme is subverted: renters who can’t take advantage of the H2B subsidy are left further behind. Table 1 shows the total H2B loans extended by the government nationally in each year since 2013; and the builders’ average profit margin and return on equity for two years before and each year after H2B began. As it is only available for new homes, a Londoner faced with the choice between a new house costing £550k and an identical second-hand house at the same price can get an H2B subsidy of around £7k a year (the interest saved) if she opts for the new house.
text_rank similarity: 0.39348369546530537
text_rank summary: But similarly, if house prices fall, then the Exchequer will be faced not just with the interest bill but also with a capital loss impairing the public sector balance sheet: the total cost of H2B will be higher still.One report suggests that H2B has allowed builders to raise selling prices by towards 10%.So on top of the pressure from existing home-owners not to suffer falls in the value of their homes, and from house- builders anxious to keep the party going, H2B creates another political imperative to keep the bubble inflating – avoiding impairment of the government’s H2B loans.
tfidf similarity: 0.4485068566920345
tfidf summary: Another is that part of the benefit of the subsidy is appropriated by the builders. So the new house will be much the better buy, and it will be worth her while to pay more for the new than for the second- hand house. Again we have analysed the information provided by companies’ annual reports on executives’ incomes and gains before and after the introduction of H2B.

Title: El Salvador's experience of UN peacebuilding reveals the ineffectiveness of 'development as usual' approaches
Word count: 1156
Abstract: To provide the vital "peace dividend" of better lives and livelihoods, peacebuilding must promote conflict-sensitive policies even where they are economically second-best. The UN can support this process by helping states in transition to reactivate their economies in an inclusive and sustainable manner, writes Graciana del Castillo (City University of New York)

basic summary: And even those that achieved a tenuous peace ended up highly aid dependent, often even for basic food needs. Lacking support, former combatants had to abandon programmes like arms-for-land that had given them a stake, however small, in the peace process.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.2564239677274669
sim_matrix summary: With the country at the brink of war only nine months after the peace agreement of January 1992, El Salvador provided early evidence of many of obstacles to peacebuilding that would later plague transitions to peace elsewhere in the world. The path to peace dividends With El Salvador now considered by most accounts a failed state, the lesson for the UN, as well as for Colombia and other countries undergoing transitions to peace, is that economic reconstruction of war-torn societies is not “development as usual”.

text_rank summary: Essentially, El Salvador showed that when economic reconstruction took place alongside efforts at national reconciliation and major reforms to politics and security, it was fundamentally different from “development as usual”.This two-way relationship between security and economy – often neglected by the UN in favour of a greater focus on human rights, elections, and gender issues – has proved to be a major obstacle to successful and sustainable transitions to peace, stability, and improved welfare.

frequency summary: Emily Holland and Hadas Aron react to this claim, most notably asserted in Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt’s new book, ‘How Democracies Die,’ noting that the decline of one of the most stable, long-lasting democracies in the world can only be compared to the decline of other lasting, consolidated democracies, of which there are none. The cases Levitsky and Ziblatt employ shed little light on current developments in American politics, and they neglect to identify the crucial international shifts leading to democratic decline in vulnerable countries.

Title: The hidden costs of research assessment exercises: the curious case of Australia
Word count: 1309
Abstract: Research assessment exercises provide the government and wider public with assurance of the quality of university research, with the guiding principles being accountability, transparency, and openness. But is there the same accountability and openness when it comes to the public cost of these large-scale exercises? Ksenia Sawczak examines the situation in Australia as the research sector looks ahead to the new Engagement and Impact Assessment later this year. There seems little doubt this exercise will demand significant resources, with no guarantee it will achieve its stated goal of improving how universities engage with industry. Until the hidden costs of assessment exercises are revealed and a thorough consideration of their general utility is undertaken, questions will remain as to whether they are a responsible use of public monies

basic summary: There seems little doubt this exercise will demand significant resources, with no guarantee it will achieve its stated goal of improving how universities engage with industry. What is curious about Australia is that ERA functions in a vacuum, conducted by government but playing no role in informing federal research policy or funding allocations to universities. The authors of the NISA boldly stated that an exercise of this kind will ultimately lead to improvements in how universities engage with industry. Ksenia Sawczak examines the situation in Australia as the research sector looks ahead to the new Engagement and Impact Assessment later this year.

sim_matrix summary: But for an exercise so firmly grounded in principles of accountability, transparency, and openness with the public – something particularly evident in prefaces to the National Reports the ARC releases after each ERA, which strongly emphasise the importance of assuring the public of the value of government investment in research – the missing element is the public cost of such an endeavour. To further complicate matters, the ARC has decided to follow in the footsteps of the UK’s Research Evaluation Framework by conducting a new assessment exercise this year – the Engagement and Impact Assessment. Across Australia, universities are in the throes of pulling together submissions to Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA) – the comprehensive assessment exercise, overseen by the Australian Research Council (ARC), which serves as a stocktake of all research conducted in Australian universities. For some time, the Australian government has been strongly concerned about the benefits of university-generated research beyond academia, leading to this new assessment exercise being announced as part of its 2015 National Innovation and Science Agenda. Until the hidden costs of assessment exercises in Australia are revealed and a thorough consideration of their general utility is undertaken, they will remain an international curiosity, with the dubious honour of serving as an example of assessment for the sake of assessment and irresponsible use of public monies.

Everyone knows them, and they are also the tool most Australian universities now use to set targets for performance and monitor their own achievements. 2018 marks the fourth running of this gigantic exercise since its introduction in 2010, and the high frequency of the exercise means universities are now well-accustomed to the never-ending cycle of submissions, with preparations for a new round commencing as soon as the previous one ends.

Apart from ERA, Australian universities undertake a multitude of other regular reporting to government in research-related areas, such as the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ Survey of Research and Experimental Development and the Department of Innovation’s National Survey of Research Commercialisation, although the submission data is not subject to evaluation.

Title: Looming REF deadlines lead to a rush in publication of lower quality research
Word count: 1280
Abstract: The increased significance of research assessments and their implications for funding and career prospects has had a knock-on effect on academic publication patterns. Moqi Groen-Xu, Pedro A. Teixeira, Thomas Voigt and Bernhard Knapp report on research that reveals a marked increase in research productivity immediately prior to an evaluation deadline, which quickly reverses once the deadline has passed. Moreoever, the quality of papers published just before deadlines is lower, as measured by citations. Those who design research assessments should consider having cycles of varying lengths across different fields, affording researchers the time and opportunity to pursue more novel, risky projects

basic summary: Our research indicates that research output does indeed change around the time researchers are submitted to assessment exercises. Those who design research assessments should consider having cycles of varying lengths across different fields, affording researchers the time and opportunity to pursue more novel, risky projects. After our research was reported on the Times Higher Education, Steven Hill – Head of Research Policy at HEFCE – raised concerns about our interpretation of the findings. Because older papers had more time to accumulate citations, information about them is more precise at that time, thus biasing the choice of older articles with higher citation counts.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.38216974100200446
sim_matrix summary: The variance in journal impact factor is higher for papers published just after the deadline, indicating that researchers did not just time their publications accordingly but possibly also pursued more novel and uncertain research projects when further from the deadline. Our research indicates that research output does indeed change around the time researchers are submitted to assessment exercises. This should allow departments with longer research cycles to pursue a more important research agenda. However, we actually observe a higher variance of quality in research published further from the deadline.

Title: EU Withdrawal Agreement: the real losers will be British businesses and British citizens

Abstract: When Britain leaves the EU in March 2019, will it become isolated and not influential, to paraphrase Sir John Major's words from his speech last week? In this blog, Monica Horten (LSE) investigates the Transition chapter of the EU Withdrawal Agreement and scrutinises how far Britain's influence could be written out from the very start

Title: The UK government is shedding some of its illusions about Brexit, and softening its position
Word count: 1040
Abstract: Step by step, the UK government is shedding some of its illusions about Brexit, argues Holger Schmieding (Berenberg). The United Kingdom has already accepted that it will have to meet the legally binding financial commitments it incurred while it was a member of the European Union (the so-called Brexit bill) and is going along with the EU's timetable for negotiations (divorce issues first, transition deal next, outlines of a future trade deal last). Last Friday saw another set of concessions being made by the Prime Minister
basic similarity: 0.29300883254900806
basic summary: Under such a deal, the UK would maintain access to the EU’s single market for goods and for some services on almost the same preferential terms as before. The only practical way in which Brexit could be reversed would be if early new elections swept a Labour-led government to power that might possibly call a new referendum. However, Theresa May is not yet close to such a deal that would minimise the economic damage to the UK.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.4964065301226049
sim_matrix summary: The only way to draw hope from the Mansion House speech is to view it as just one of many steps on the long road from British Brexit illusions to an acceptance of reality: the UK government can either insist on its positions and suffer a hard Brexit without a significant deal with the EU or accept the terms for a preferential market access agreement that the EU can offer – or possibly reconsider Brexit once it has become fully clear what Brexit will entail in practice. If Theresa May continues to ditch one illusion after the other, making the UK position progressively more realistic without shattering her fractious government in the process, the UK may still end up with the semi-soft or soft Brexit that minimises the economic damage for the UK. As a result, any deal will reflect the bargaining position of the EU much more than the wishes of the UK government.

Third, as Ireland is the EU27 country most affected by Brexit, the EU has de facto granted Ireland a veto over the terms of any deal on post-Brexit relations which the EU27 can strike with the UK. On the most fundamental level, May does not yet seem to acknowledge three key facts: First, the medium-sized UK earns 12 per cent of its GDP through exports to the EU27 whereas the EU27 send exports worth merely 3 per cent of their GDP to the UK.

In her speech at Mansion House last Friday, Prime Minister Theresa May went one step further, acknowledging that the UK has to face “hard facts” on Brexit and that “life is going to be different after Brexit”. If we extrapolate the British learning curve into the future, reason may still prevail in the end with an agreement on a “soft” or “semi-soft” Brexit by October 2018, in time for both sides to ratify it before the UK formally leaves the EU on 29 March 2019.

A new partnership body, Productivity UK, should also be established with the goal of raising firm-level productivity, including the acceleration of investment in automation technologies. Whereas past waves of automation typically required machines to have a clear set of instructions in structured environments to enable them to perform tasks once done by humans, today’s machines can act without explicit instruction in complex environments.

Kate Botterill (Edinburgh Napier University) discusses how the result and subsequent uncertainty affected them, and the strategies they have adopted to deal with it. Post-Brexit, the Scottish Government want a different approach to migration from the rest of the UK, which may lead to stronger identification with Scotland among many Poles living in the country. Nonetheless, Scottish public attitudes towards migration appear to be hardening

When it comes to migration, Scotland is widely considered to be on a different political journey to the rest of the UK.

Title: The crisis in social care is connected to the gendered inadequacy of labour law
Word count: 1218
Abstract: Lydia Hayes writes that social care is a feminist issue. Highlighting some of the appalling conditions that care workers tolerate, she explains how employment law fails to protect women's employment and to value feminised labour. She concludes that unless social care provision is revolutionised, women will have little choice but to serve as unpaid carers: stuck at home, excluded from public life, and denied life choices

The inadequacy of minimum wage law The financial crisis of 2007/2008 heralded UK labour market changes in which care work became the largest source of low-waged work for women. Care workers are failed by the current right to a minimum wage where their work is not recognised as ‘work’ for the purposes of statutory pay protection.

sim_matrix summary: When the social care minimum wage scandal of 2017 highlighted that thousands of care workers were paid nothing more than pocket-money to ensure the overnight well-being of vulnerable adults, employers were outraged that they should have to pay care workers what was legally owed. Until the wages of care workers are free from sexist devaluation, and until the work of care workers is fully recognised, the labour of all women is devalued. If we continue to tolerate care workers being employed to work without pay, the future of care work will be based on sexist expectations that care work should be done for free.

text_rank summary: Although the right to a minimum wage was supposed to prevent exploitation, it has become standard industry practice for care workers to work for free during increasingly large parts of each working day.A sex- based ideology about women’s subservience to the needs of others still circulates in the contemporary labour market, and minimum wage law does not do enough to assert the value of care work.If we continue to tolerate care workers being employed to work without pay, the future of care work will be based on sexist expectations that care work should be done for free.

frequency summary: Inadequacies in equal pay law perpetuate the historic subordination of women in low-waged work, prevent care workers from achieving economic independence, and exemplify the economic invisibility of skills and abilities which are thought to arise ‘naturally’ in women. Care workers are failed by the current right to a minimum wage where their work is not recognised as ‘work’ for the purposes of statutory pay protection. Where women do not work in close proximity to men, equal pay law offers very little and prevents women from comparing their wages to those of men who do not work for the same employer.

Title: High prices, not waste or over-use, drive high health care costs in the US
Word count: 881
Abstract: The US spends nearly 18 percent of its GDP on health care, making it a real outlier among high-income countries in this area. But what is behind this unusually high level of health care spending? Irene Papanicolas investigates common beliefs about why spending is so high, including that US residents use more health care services, have poorer quality of care, and use 'too much' inpatient care. She finds that higher costs in the US are largely driven by higher prices across a wide range of health care services such as surgical procedures and drugs, as well as administrative complexity and costs
basic similarity: 0.5571066253885557
basic summary: The data suggest two main factors drive health care spending in the US: higher prices across a wide range of health care services and administrative complexity and costs. Evidence: The US has among the lowest proportion of health care spending on inpatient services (19 percent) and among the highest for outpatient services (42 percent). While low social spending may contribute to poorer population health outcomes, it is unlikely a primary driver of higher health care spending. Belief 1: The US spends more than other countries because US residents consume much more health care services.

Title: How we can preserve assisted housing in the context of gentrification and constrained federal resources
Word count: 1239
Abstract: Like many American cities, Washington DC is experiencing a squeeze in its affordable housing: population increases and declining stocks of government subsidized housing are making it harder for low-income households to find somewhere to live. In new research, Kathryn Howell looks at how existing assisted housing in Washington, DC is being preserved in the face of gentrification and funding challenges. She writes that preservation is a long and complex process that engages diverse stakeholders from tenants and tenant organizers to local and federal agency staff
basic similarity: 0.4912927530547169
basic summary: This case offers powerful support for increased collaboration between stakeholders and meaningful local laws and flexible funding for the preservation of affordable housing. But developing new funding sources and programs for the complex process of preservation requires multiple private and government stakeholders, shared governance and access to data. She writes that preservation is a long and complex process that engages diverse stakeholders from tenants and tenant organizers to local and federal agency staff.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.4140020542281627
sim_matrix summary: The DC Preservation Network is a monthly meeting of preservation stakeholders from tenant organizers to federal government staff. These stakeholders used a mix local policies, including local tenant protections, flexible funding sources such as DC’s Housing Production Trust Fund, and laws that enabled access to the housing market such as the Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act, which gives tenants the right of first refusal when their building is for sale. One example of the process for preservation and loss is Museum Square Apartments in Washington, DC.
text_rank similarity: 0.367286731061832
text_rank summary: Federal resources have declined for 40 years in the United States, leaving many cities and states, regardless of the market, at a loss to support the development and preservation of affordable housing.However, the Museum Square One case is just one example of the way affordable housing leaves the subsidized stock, as well as the efforts made by a broad group of stakeholders to try to preserve it.Many cities – like the District of Columbia – have begun to understand that production of units using federal funds only approaches a portion of the problem in the face of the growth in many US cities that has made neighbourhoods unaffordable for low- and moderate-income households.

In Washington, buildings were tracked by the preservation network for an average of 16 months before they were lost – many of those buildings had been tracked multiple times by the group, suggesting that there are clear opportunities for stakeholders to engage with the building owner, residents and funders. Because of the diverse scale impacts of affordable housing – city, neighbourhood, building and tenant – as well as the dimensions of funding, code enforcement and daily living, there must be an avenue through which data can be shared to create a more complete picture of the building’s status.

Title: How will Brexit affect the social security rights of EU migrants in the UK, and how the social protection of EU staff?
Word count: 1410
Abstract: Linda Hantrais focuses on two ways in which social security provisions may be affected by Brexit: the social security rights of EU migrants to the UK, where EU institutions have come to play an important coordinating role; and, the social protection rights of British officials working for EU institutions, where benefits and employers' contributions are paid from the EU administrative budget to which the UK contributes
basic similarity: 0.23942164966042798
basic summary: In the European Pillar of Social Rights, Juncker set out his strategy for achieving ‘upward convergence’ between EU Member States with ‘social protection as a productive factor’.

Title: Critical actors and abortion law: a group of individuals in Northern Irish politics obstructs change
Word count: 965
Abstract: There are various reasons why progress on legal abortion in Northern Ireland has been blocked over the years. Key among them is that individual politicians rule out any suggestion of change, writes Jennifer Thomson. She argues that more attention should be given to the actions of individual actors, considering their role can often be as important as that of political parties or institutions
basic similarity: 0.3653035509601473
basic summary: Feminist political scientists have long employed the concept of ‘critical actors’ to refer to key individuals who instigate positive change within political institutions. Attempts to change abortion policy at the moment are also not helped by the fact that Northern Ireland is facing one of its most challenging political periods in decades. When considering why some policies are difficult to change, or even to implement at all, consideration must be given to the actions of individual members of political institutions.

sim_matrix summary: Abortion in particular has long been a political football in Northern Irish politics following devolution. Attempts to change abortion policy at the moment are also not helped by the fact that Northern Ireland is facing one of its most challenging political periods in decades. For much of Northern Ireland’s devolved period therefore, abortion has been a political stumbling block.

text_rank summary: Attempts to change abortion policy at the moment are also not helped by the fact that Northern Ireland is facing one of its most challenging political periods in decades.This has been the case in Northern Ireland, where a small number of critical actors have obstructed change on abortion for many years.Following only three years on from the country’s historic same sex marriage referendum, Ireland appears to be moving from one of the more socially conservative countries in western Europe to one which is signalling a new, liberal dawn.

tfidf summary: Although Northern Irish women can now access abortions on the NHS in England, thanks to Stella Creasy’s amendment to the Queen’s speech, this does nothing to change the strict legal situation in Northern Ireland, nor does it help with the financial costs of travelling for the procedure. This has been the case in Northern Ireland, where a small number of critical actors have obstructed change on abortion for many years. In 2013, Paul Girvan DUP MLA and Alban Maginness SDLP MLA attempted to outlaw any private abortion providers in Northern Ireland which would have closed down the newly opened Marie Stopes clinic in central Belfast.

Indeed, in the wake of the DUP confidence and supply arrangement with Theresa May’s government, much was made of the DUP’s social conservatism in the British press and Northern Ireland’s variance from the rest of the UK.

Title: The origins of city centrism: 'the potential of Glasgow city centre'
Word count: 1065
Abstract: Andy Pike analyses some of the themes in the 1983 report 'The Potential of Glasgow City Centre', an early example of city centrism with a policy repertoire that has since influenced urban and regional development thinking. He explains why, 35 years on, city centrism presents more of a mixed picture than a panacea for urban policy; in a separate post he offers thoughts on the way forward

basic summary: City policies – such as spatial planning, city centre regeneration, investment attraction, innovation, and skills – have supported structural evolution towards services. A central city focus upon the needs and dynamism of the urban core as the “natural location” for most business and many consumer services.

Title: The limits of city centrism? We need to rethink how we approach urban and regional development
Word count: 1257
Abstract: Following on from his previous analysis on why city centrism has not turned out to be a panacea for urban development so far, Andy Pike argues it is time for fresh thinking. He explains why we need to find better ways to think about and design policies that support the combination of the dynamism of Britain's city centres
basic similarity: 0.2048261698093464
basic summary: High skilled employment and agglomeration are necessary but not sufficient for city growth On city skills, city growth and high-skilled occupations are closely related. But the city centrism propositions of ‘smart cities becoming smarter’, and a positive relationship between agglomeration and high skilled employment growth do not appear to apply to British cities.

sim_matrix summary: City centrism isn’t everything for urban growth Emergent research from the ESRC-funded city evolutions research project into the urban predicament in British cities since the early 1970s raises some difficult issues for city centrism. High skilled employment and agglomeration are necessary but not sufficient for city growth On city skills, city growth and high-skilled occupations are closely related.

text_rank summary: Taking a longer-term evolutionary approach can help us understand when, where and why agglomeration as well as other factors such as their functions and non-spatial public policies may be important for certain economic activities and cities.Reducing the reliance upon thinking that is conceived from a particular US perspective and draws heavily upon empirical data from US cities might be a way to recover traditions of urban and regional analysis better able to explain the particularities of the British urban system.

tfidf summary: For some city-regions, these seem to have been intermittent, weak or close to non-existent since the 1970s. Reducing the reliance upon thinking that is conceived from a particular US perspective and draws heavily upon empirical data from US cities might be a way to recover traditions of urban and regional analysis better able to explain the particularities of the British urban system.

frequency summary: Economic logics and policy repertoires The economic logic is based upon ‘external economies of agglomeration’ generated by thick labour markets of educated and skilled labour, spill-overs of innovations, market size effects, and linkages amongst associated goods and services activities as the route to higher productivity, economic growth, innovation, incomes and prosperity in cities. Productivity growth is not guaranteed with services and scale On city productivity growth, northern cities led during the 1970s and 1980s through manufacturing specialisation until their struggle with deindustrialisation led to a switch to southern cities from the 1990s.
