Word count: 1695
Abstract: Through the story of Chol, LSE’s Naomi Pendle explores the meaning of exile and the lived experience of being a refugee through cycles of displacement and return. In the first article of this two-part series, Pendle tells us how Chol rebuilt home after years spent in exile. Now, LSE’s Naomi Pendle narrates Chol’s return into exile, a journey that was in itself a return and cemented his ability to build a family
basic similarity: 0.34753237713708945
basic summary: Now, LSE’s Naomi Pendle narrates Chol’s return into exile, a journey that was in itself a return and cemented his ability to build a family. It was these networks, as much as a journey to a safe space, that he sought to cement as safety for himself, his wife and his son. Yet, they knew that the journey would be fraught with dangers and force them to weave between government and rebel held territories.

sim_matrix summary: Safety for Chol was the return to northern Sudan and the familiar values of business. He feared others would advise against this journey as people had already tried to reach Khartoum and not all had been safe. Yet, they knew that the journey would be fraught with dangers and force them to weave between government and rebel held territories.

Title: Young people are highly critical of Brexit and fear the insularity it could bring
Word count: 1070
Abstract: Most young people did not support Brexit and the referendum result left many feeling frustrated and disempowered, write Shakuntala Banaji and Sam Mejias (LSE). They fear the vote will make the UK more insular and are highly critical of the way the campaign was conducted. In focus groups, they showed a strong understanding of the EU – and want a Brexit settlement that tackles inequality as well as ensuring Britain is an open and welcoming country
basic similarity: 0.32409041521935816
basic summary: A minority of respondents asserted that the referendum and subsequent events had been a ‘participation catalyst’ for young people to become more politically active. As soon as people voted leave, there were attacks on minorities…I don’t know [if] people thought it was more OK to be racist, because they were leaving [the EU]. Secondly, young people expressed dissatisfaction that the oldest generations (65+) should have such a disproportionate influence on the futures of the youngest citizens.

sim_matrix summary: With no funding, but assisted by a fantastic group of youth partners (including youth participation NGO My Life My Say and the All Party Parliamentary Group on a Better Brexit for Young People) we set up a series of focus groups across the UK to find out what young people from 13 to 30 think and feel about Brexit, and what they want out of the Brexit process. (Youth participant from Falkirk & Clackmannanshire, Scotland) Priorities and hopes It will come as no surprise then that a majority of young people in our study were adamant that they want the post- Brexit UK to be a better place than the UK is now, that they want negotiations to retain the rights and benefits associated with Europe today – freedom of movement, human and civil rights protections, subsidies, the single market – while also tackling inequality that has risen due to austerity. Although these were complex, and not a simple matter of the young ‘blaming’ everyone older than them, we were told of two levels of resentment: in the first case, young people under 18 felt deprived of a voice and overwhelmingly said that if they could, they would have voted to remain.

Title: The political significance of Poland's government reshuffle
Word count: 1984
Abstract: A sweeping reshuffle by Poland's new prime minister has changed the shape and direction of its government, with a greater emphasis being placed on economic modernisation, political stabilisation and improving EU relations. But as Aleks Szczerbiak writes, this pivot to the technocratic centre risks alienating the ruling party's core electorate, and is more about packaging the government's reforms attractively than abandoning its its radical state re-construction programme
basic similarity: 0.17253571958097957
basic summary: Most Law and Justice deputies support this, but in autumn 2016 large protests forced the ruling party to vote down a previous attempt to introduce greater restrictions. Cardiologist and deputy higher education minister Łukasz Szumowski took over as health minister from Konstanty Radziwiłł, who failed to resolve a high profile dispute involving resident doctors.

sim_matrix summary: Mr Morawiecki clearly enjoys Mr Kaczyński’s trust and there is even speculation that the Law and Justice leader is grooming him as his long-term successor.

text_rank summary: Indeed, some commentators have suggested that the reshuffle may be part of a more ambitious, long-term project of transforming Law and Justice into a pragmatic conservative grouping; although others dismiss it as simply a tactical pivot similar to the one that the party performed so successfully in the run-up to the 2015 elections.Beata Szydło’s administration took the political flak for introducing these reforms but, with the passage of the judicial reform laws at the end of last year, many of the key elements of the government’s state re-construction programme are now in place.

Title: What the 2015 Greek debt negotiations tell us about Germany's negotiating stance on Brexit
Word count: 1401
Abstract: If the UK wants to secure favourable terms during the Brexit negotiations, it will be crucial to win the support of Germany. But what are the key German priorities as the talks move on to the second phase? Luuk Molthof writes that the 2015 Greek debt negotiations offer some insights into the German approach, and that the UK is likely to be disappointed if it believes Germany will put economic interests above its political support for European integration

basic summary: To understand why the British government would do well to heed these warnings, it is useful to be reminded of Germany’s role in the 2015 Greek bailout negotiations. The reason why Germany ultimately agreed to another bailout was because a Greek exit from the eurozone would undermine the euro’s credibility as an instrument of political integration. Yet in order to protect the euro’s role as a political instrument, Germany was willing to bear the economic costs.

Title: Quantity does matter as citation impact increases with productivity
Word count: 1040
Abstract: Many scholars are encouraged to focus on the quality not the quantity of their publications, the rationale being that becoming too focused on productivity risks reducing the quality of one's work. But is this, in fact, the case? Peter van den Besselaar and Ulf Sandström have studied a large sample of researchers and found that, while results vary by field, there is a positive and stronger than linear relationship between productivity and quality (in terms of the top cited papers). This same pattern appears to apply to institutions as well as individual researchers
basic similarity: 0.4164438026846855
basic summary: Figure 3: Relationship between number of papers per university and impact in terms of Top10% papers. For each researcher we calculated the (field-normalised and fractionally counted) total number of publications and also the number of those publications that figure in the (2.5%) highest cited papers. In the social sciences, the (slightly) “diminishing returns” pattern seems to dominate; whereas the “impact ceiling” pattern was found for computer science & mathematics and for the humanities. Higher numbers of papers do result in even higher numbers of top cited papers.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.5156065182243281
sim_matrix summary: Figure 1 shows the various possible relationships between “quality” and “quantity” that may exist: (i) there may be an “impact ceiling”, meaning that after a certain number of papers the number of highly cited papers stabilises; there could be (ii) diminishing; (iii) constant; or even (iv) increasing “impact returns” from productivity; and finally (v) “small may be beautiful” in the sense that the number of high-impact papers decreases when authors become too productive, trading quality for quantity. Our understanding, developed in a recent PLoS ONE paper, is that there is a positive and stronger than linear relationship between productivity and quality (in terms of the top cited papers). We tested this using the Leiden Ranking 2014, which details the number of papers and the number of papers belonging to the top 10% highly cited papers for all universities included. This size effect also holds at organisational level, something we did not address in the PLoS ONE paper but tested after a reviewer claimed the opposite: “the CWTS Leiden Ranking, for example, does not show such a linear relationship as the authors claim between the number of papers produced by a university and the percentage of highly cited papers produced by that university”.

Abstract: The rise of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) was one of the major stories of the 2017 German elections. As Tomá\v Nociar and Jan Philipp Thomeczek write, there has been a tendency among some commentators to draw parallels between the AfD and extremist or fascist parties from Germany's past. They argue that this is both unhelpful and inaccurate, and that the AfD has far more in common with other ‘populist’ parties who have had success in recent European elections
