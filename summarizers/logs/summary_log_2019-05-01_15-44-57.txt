basic summary: Now, LSE’s Naomi Pendle narrates Chol’s return into exile, a journey that was in itself a return and cemented his ability to build a family. It was these networks, as much as a journey to a safe space, that he sought to cement as safety for himself, his wife and his son. Yet, they knew that the journey would be fraught with dangers and force them to weave between government and rebel held territories.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.256625691072223
sim_matrix summary: Safety for Chol was the return to northern Sudan and the familiar values of business. He feared others would advise against this journey as people had already tried to reach Khartoum and not all had been safe. Yet, they knew that the journey would be fraught with dangers and force them to weave between government and rebel held territories.

Title: Young people are highly critical of Brexit and fear the insularity it could bring
Word count: 1070
Abstract: Most young people did not support Brexit and the referendum result left many feeling frustrated and disempowered, write Shakuntala Banaji and Sam Mejias (LSE). They fear the vote will make the UK more insular and are highly critical of the way the campaign was conducted. In focus groups, they showed a strong understanding of the EU – and want a Brexit settlement that tackles inequality as well as ensuring Britain is an open and welcoming country
basic similarity: 0.32409041521935816
basic summary: A minority of respondents asserted that the referendum and subsequent events had been a ‘participation catalyst’ for young people to become more politically active. As soon as people voted leave, there were attacks on minorities…I don’t know [if] people thought it was more OK to be racist, because they were leaving [the EU]. Secondly, young people expressed dissatisfaction that the oldest generations (65+) should have such a disproportionate influence on the futures of the youngest citizens.

sim_matrix summary: With no funding, but assisted by a fantastic group of youth partners (including youth participation NGO My Life My Say and the All Party Parliamentary Group on a Better Brexit for Young People) we set up a series of focus groups across the UK to find out what young people from 13 to 30 think and feel about Brexit, and what they want out of the Brexit process. (Youth participant from Falkirk & Clackmannanshire, Scotland) Priorities and hopes It will come as no surprise then that a majority of young people in our study were adamant that they want the post- Brexit UK to be a better place than the UK is now, that they want negotiations to retain the rights and benefits associated with Europe today – freedom of movement, human and civil rights protections, subsidies, the single market – while also tackling inequality that has risen due to austerity. Although these were complex, and not a simple matter of the young ‘blaming’ everyone older than them, we were told of two levels of resentment: in the first case, young people under 18 felt deprived of a voice and overwhelmingly said that if they could, they would have voted to remain.

tfidf summary: Can’t we just stop talking about Brexit?’ Some people have simply had enough. Although many insisted that these were tendencies that had been in evidence before the referendum campaign due to the underfunding of public services and the increase in low-paid insecure work, most insisted that the vote to leave had made things worse. As soon as people voted leave, there were attacks on minorities…I don’t know [if] people thought it was more OK to be racist, because they were leaving [the EU].

Title: What precisely does 'Canada +++' mean?
Word count: 2475
Abstract: The Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, has described his plans for a future trading arrangement with the EU as 'Canada plus plus plus'. But what precisely does this expression mean, if anything, and what are the trade and political implications? Andrew Blick (KCL and the Federal Trust) explains

sim_matrix summary: Moreover, to refer to UK trade with the EU is – at present – misleading. The European Council guidelines issued on 29 April, following the UK Article 50 notification of a month beforehand, noted that the UK government wanted to leave the Single Market, and seek ‘an ambitious’ FTA with the EU. The ‘have our cake and eat it’ option vaunted by ‘leave’ optimists – whereby the UK retains those aspects of EU membership it wishes to while jettisoning the others – is clearly excluded by the EU position papers.

tfidf summary: This stance on the part of the EU27 should not be surprising. The European Council guidelines issued on 29 April, following the UK Article 50 notification of a month beforehand, noted that the UK government wanted to leave the Single Market, and seek ‘an ambitious’ FTA with the EU. In current circumstance, on the other hand, the repetition of the statements ‘exiting the Customs Union means exiting the Customs Union’ and ‘exiting the Single Market means exiting the Single Market’ could be helpful.

frequency summary: However, such a deal could not, for the UK, ‘amount to participation in the Single Market or parts thereof, as this would undermine its [the Single Market’s] integrity and proper functioning.’ The FTA had to ‘ensure a level playing field’, especially in such areas as ‘competition and state aid’, prohibiting ‘unfair competitive advantages’ using such means as taxes and regulations. Taking this trajectory into account, the European Council would ensure that future ‘trade and economic cooperation’ would provide expression to ‘a balance of rights and obligations, preserve a level playing field, avoid upsetting existing relations with other third countries, and…preserve the integrity and proper functioning of the Single Market.’ Government’s hopes for a Canada-styled agreement LSE Brexit: What precisely does ‘Canada +++’ mean?
