basic summary: Now, LSE’s Naomi Pendle narrates Chol’s return into exile, a journey that was in itself a return and cemented his ability to build a family. It was these networks, as much as a journey to a safe space, that he sought to cement as safety for himself, his wife and his son. Yet, they knew that the journey would be fraught with dangers and force them to weave between government and rebel held territories.

sim_matrix summary: Safety for Chol was the return to northern Sudan and the familiar values of business. He feared others would advise against this journey as people had already tried to reach Khartoum and not all had been safe. Yet, they knew that the journey would be fraught with dangers and force them to weave between government and rebel held territories.

Title: Young people are highly critical of Brexit and fear the insularity it could bring
Word count: 1070
Abstract: Most young people did not support Brexit and the referendum result left many feeling frustrated and disempowered, write Shakuntala Banaji and Sam Mejias (LSE). They fear the vote will make the UK more insular and are highly critical of the way the campaign was conducted. In focus groups, they showed a strong understanding of the EU – and want a Brexit settlement that tackles inequality as well as ensuring Britain is an open and welcoming country

basic summary: A minority of respondents asserted that the referendum and subsequent events had been a ‘participation catalyst’ for young people to become more politically active. As soon as people voted leave, there were attacks on minorities…I don’t know [if] people thought it was more OK to be racist, because they were leaving [the EU]. Secondly, young people expressed dissatisfaction that the oldest generations (65+) should have such a disproportionate influence on the futures of the youngest citizens.

Although these were complex, and not a simple matter of the young ‘blaming’ everyone older than them, we were told of two levels of resentment: in the first case, young people under 18 felt deprived of a voice and overwhelmingly said that if they could, they would have voted to remain.

Title: The political significance of Poland's government reshuffle

Abstract: A sweeping reshuffle by Poland's new prime minister has changed the shape and direction of its government, with a greater emphasis being placed on economic modernisation, political stabilisation and improving EU relations. But as Aleks Szczerbiak writes, this pivot to the technocratic centre risks alienating the ruling party's core electorate, and is more about packaging the government's reforms attractively than abandoning its its radical state re-construction programme

Title: What the 2015 Greek debt negotiations tell us about Germany's negotiating stance on Brexit
Word count: 1401
Abstract: If the UK wants to secure favourable terms during the Brexit negotiations, it will be crucial to win the support of Germany. But what are the key German priorities as the talks move on to the second phase? Luuk Molthof writes that the 2015 Greek debt negotiations offer some insights into the German approach, and that the UK is likely to be disappointed if it believes Germany will put economic interests above its political support for European integration
basic similarity: 0.46739467262411993
basic summary: To understand why the British government would do well to heed these warnings, it is useful to be reminded of Germany’s role in the 2015 Greek bailout negotiations. The reason why Germany ultimately agreed to another bailout was because a Greek exit from the eurozone would undermine the euro’s credibility as an instrument of political integration. Yet in order to protect the euro’s role as a political instrument, Germany was willing to bear the economic costs.

text_rank similarity: 0.31522305146551355
text_rank summary: Assuming the VFL bill makes it beyond the second reading, we can expect any subsequent parliamentary debate to be highly politicised: opposition parties see VFL not as a progressive move to end the disenfranchisement of potentially millions of its citizens living outside the UK, but as a cynical ploy to increase Tory votes and donations (individuals can only donate if they are on an electoral register).This is further corroborated by the simultaneous statement from the Chair of ‘Conservatives Abroad’, Heather Harper, who welcomed the government’s renewed commitment to VFL: “The second reading of [the Overseas Electors Bill] brings us closer to getting votes for life for all British expatriates”.Certain campaigners have suggested that the creation of dedicated ‘overseas’ constituencies, such as those created by France, Italy, and Portugal, would avoid the problems of establishing proof of previous registration or residence, and would give expats better representation.

Title: Quantity does matter as citation impact increases with productivity
Word count: 1040
Abstract: Many scholars are encouraged to focus on the quality not the quantity of their publications, the rationale being that becoming too focused on productivity risks reducing the quality of one's work. But is this, in fact, the case? Peter van den Besselaar and Ulf Sandström have studied a large sample of researchers and found that, while results vary by field, there is a positive and stronger than linear relationship between productivity and quality (in terms of the top cited papers). This same pattern appears to apply to institutions as well as individual researchers

For each researcher we calculated the (field-normalised and fractionally counted) total number of publications and also the number of those publications that figure in the (2.5%) highest cited papers. In the social sciences, the (slightly) “diminishing returns” pattern seems to dominate; whereas the “impact ceiling” pattern was found for computer science & mathematics and for the humanities. Higher numbers of papers do result in even higher numbers of top cited papers.

sim_matrix summary: Figure 1 shows the various possible relationships between “quality” and “quantity” that may exist: (i) there may be an “impact ceiling”, meaning that after a certain number of papers the number of highly cited papers stabilises; there could be (ii) diminishing; (iii) constant; or even (iv) increasing “impact returns” from productivity; and finally (v) “small may be beautiful” in the sense that the number of high-impact papers decreases when authors become too productive, trading quality for quantity. Our understanding, developed in a recent PLoS ONE paper, is that there is a positive and stronger than linear relationship between productivity and quality (in terms of the top cited papers). We tested this using the Leiden Ranking 2014, which details the number of papers and the number of papers belonging to the top 10% highly cited papers for all universities included. This size effect also holds at organisational level, something we did not address in the PLoS ONE paper but tested after a reviewer claimed the opposite: “the CWTS Leiden Ranking, for example, does not show such a linear relationship as the authors claim between the number of papers produced by a university and the percentage of highly cited papers produced by that university”.

Title: Far right politics in Germany: from fascism to populism?
Word count: 1533
Abstract: The rise of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) was one of the major stories of the 2017 German elections. As Tomá\v Nociar and Jan Philipp Thomeczek write, there has been a tendency among some commentators to draw parallels between the AfD and extremist or fascist parties from Germany's past. They argue that this is both unhelpful and inaccurate, and that the AfD has far more in common with other ‘populist’ parties who have had success in recent European elections
basic similarity: 0.3153863617359825
basic summary: This new type of populist radical right party either never developed or dropped the antidemocratic sentiment in favour of a populist critique of the establishment. It is the rise of a populist radical right that is successful precisely because of its populism and not because it embodies fascism or extremism. There is a current, often criticised trend to use the term populism to describe contemporary far right politics.

It is the rise of a populist radical right that is successful precisely because of its populism and not because it embodies fascism or extremism. Several authors point out that it is precisely populism that distinguishes the traditional post-war antidemocratic extreme right, which was inspired by interwar fascist movements, from the modern populist far right parties.

Title: Who is helped by Help to Buy?
Word count: 1831
Abstract: What's not to like about a policy which can expand home ownership and boost the supply of housing? Geoff Meeks and J.Gay Meeks recount some of the doubts about the efficacy of the government's Help to Buy scheme. They present new evidence on some of its regressive distributional consequences, and touch on the opportunity cost of the subsidy programme
basic similarity: 0.407356173557794
basic summary: These are “equity loans”, which means the government’s stake in a participating house changes at the same rate with the value of the house. As house prices rise, the argument goes, the government achieves capital gains, which offset the interest costs of servicing the debt which funds H2B. So the new house will be much the better buy, and it will be worth her while to pay more for the new than for the second- hand house.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.42080610435706217
sim_matrix summary: One consequence of the H2B subsidy further stoking the inflation of house prices is that the initial aim of the scheme is subverted: renters who can’t take advantage of the H2B subsidy are left further behind. Table 1 shows the total H2B loans extended by the government nationally in each year since 2013; and the builders’ average profit margin and return on equity for two years before and each year after H2B began. As it is only available for new homes, a Londoner faced with the choice between a new house costing £550k and an identical second-hand house at the same price can get an H2B subsidy of around £7k a year (the interest saved) if she opts for the new house.
text_rank similarity: 0.39348369546530537
text_rank summary: But similarly, if house prices fall, then the Exchequer will be faced not just with the interest bill but also with a capital loss impairing the public sector balance sheet: the total cost of H2B will be higher still.One report suggests that H2B has allowed builders to raise selling prices by towards 10%.So on top of the pressure from existing home-owners not to suffer falls in the value of their homes, and from house- builders anxious to keep the party going, H2B creates another political imperative to keep the bubble inflating – avoiding impairment of the government’s H2B loans.
tfidf similarity: 0.4485068566920345

So the new house will be much the better buy, and it will be worth her while to pay more for the new than for the second- hand house. Again we have analysed the information provided by companies’ annual reports on executives’ incomes and gains before and after the introduction of H2B.

Title: El Salvador's experience of UN peacebuilding reveals the ineffectiveness of 'development as usual' approaches
Word count: 1156
Abstract: To provide the vital "peace dividend" of better lives and livelihoods, peacebuilding must promote conflict-sensitive policies even where they are economically second-best.

Title: Engaging with Parliament: what is good Select Committee evidence?
Word count: 1267
Abstract: One way of trying to make an impact with one's research is to use it to provide evidence and information to one of Parliament's Select Committees. Victoria Honour offers some insight into how these committees and their inquiries work, and how academics can engage with them; including practical advice on how to structure and present written evidence, and information on what academic training and further resources are available

Title: We don't know how democracies die

Abstract: Since the election of Donald Trump, many have expressed their concern that the United States could slip into an authoritarian backslide. Emily Holland and Hadas Aron react to this claim, most notably asserted in Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt's new book, 'How Democracies Die,' noting that the decline of one of the most stable, long-lasting democracies in the world can only be compared to the decline of other lasting, consolidated democracies, of which there are none

Title: The hidden costs of research assessment exercises: the curious case of Australia
Word count: 1309
Abstract: Research assessment exercises provide the government and wider public with assurance of the quality of university research, with the guiding principles being accountability, transparency, and openness. But is there the same accountability and openness when it comes to the public cost of these large-scale exercises? Ksenia Sawczak examines the situation in Australia as the research sector looks ahead to the new Engagement and Impact Assessment later this year. There seems little doubt this exercise will demand significant resources, with no guarantee it will achieve its stated goal of improving how universities engage with industry. Until the hidden costs of assessment exercises are revealed and a thorough consideration of their general utility is undertaken, questions will remain as to whether they are a responsible use of public monies

basic summary: There seems little doubt this exercise will demand significant resources, with no guarantee it will achieve its stated goal of improving how universities engage with industry. What is curious about Australia is that ERA functions in a vacuum, conducted by government but playing no role in informing federal research policy or funding allocations to universities. The authors of the NISA boldly stated that an exercise of this kind will ultimately lead to improvements in how universities engage with industry. Ksenia Sawczak examines the situation in Australia as the research sector looks ahead to the new Engagement and Impact Assessment later this year.

sim_matrix summary: But for an exercise so firmly grounded in principles of accountability, transparency, and openness with the public – something particularly evident in prefaces to the National Reports the ARC releases after each ERA, which strongly emphasise the importance of assuring the public of the value of government investment in research – the missing element is the public cost of such an endeavour. To further complicate matters, the ARC has decided to follow in the footsteps of the UK’s Research Evaluation Framework by conducting a new assessment exercise this year – the Engagement and Impact Assessment. Across Australia, universities are in the throes of pulling together submissions to Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA) – the comprehensive assessment exercise, overseen by the Australian Research Council (ARC), which serves as a stocktake of all research conducted in Australian universities. For some time, the Australian government has been strongly concerned about the benefits of university-generated research beyond academia, leading to this new assessment exercise being announced as part of its 2015 National Innovation and Science Agenda. Until the hidden costs of assessment exercises in Australia are revealed and a thorough consideration of their general utility is undertaken, they will remain an international curiosity, with the dubious honour of serving as an example of assessment for the sake of assessment and irresponsible use of public monies.

text_rank summary: While it is not known what this will entail (and questions of privacy have been raised as matters of concern), it is clear the ARC is committed to making sure the public has as much information as possible on how universities are performing across disciplines and across different elements of the exercise.In spite of this and the many other concerns raised by universities about the burden associated with a new exercise, the Engagement and Impact Assessment is well and truly underway.This was never more apparent than in a subtle change made by the ARC to guidelines for the 2018 round that has implications with regard to openness, yet nearly went unnoticed; namely, the decision not to collect information from universities on the amount of time spent on preparing submissions.Thus, the end result is a complex exercise comprising four pieces of narrative for each discipline: an explanation of the engagement activities undertaken during the reference period which underpin the data a context for the engagement data (it’s not really clear what the ARC wants to see here, but presumably it is a statement that further describes the data which would obviously make no sense to evaluators if looked at in isolation) an impact study a detailed statement on approaches to impact (which will probably, by nature, end up repeating much of the engagement element).But for an exercise so firmly grounded in principles of accountability, transparency, and openness with the public – something particularly evident in prefaces to the National Reports the ARC releases after each ERA, which strongly emphasise the importance of assuring the public of the value of government investment in research – the missing element is the public cost of such an endeavour.

In spite of this and the many other concerns raised by universities about the burden associated with a new exercise, the Engagement and Impact Assessment is well and truly underway. Everyone knows them, and they are also the tool most Australian universities now use to set targets for performance and monitor their own achievements. 2018 marks the fourth running of this gigantic exercise since its introduction in 2010, and the high frequency of the exercise means universities are now well-accustomed to the never-ending cycle of submissions, with preparations for a new round commencing as soon as the previous one ends.

Apart from ERA, Australian universities undertake a multitude of other regular reporting to government in research-related areas, such as the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ Survey of Research and Experimental Development and the Department of Innovation’s National Survey of Research Commercialisation, although the submission data is not subject to evaluation.

Title: Looming REF deadlines lead to a rush in publication of lower quality research
Word count: 1280
Abstract: The increased significance of research assessments and their implications for funding and career prospects has had a knock-on effect on academic publication patterns. Moqi Groen-Xu, Pedro A. Teixeira, Thomas Voigt and Bernhard Knapp report on research that reveals a marked increase in research productivity immediately prior to an evaluation deadline, which quickly reverses once the deadline has passed. Moreoever, the quality of papers published just before deadlines is lower, as measured by citations. Those who design research assessments should consider having cycles of varying lengths across different fields, affording researchers the time and opportunity to pursue more novel, risky projects

basic summary: Our research indicates that research output does indeed change around the time researchers are submitted to assessment exercises. Those who design research assessments should consider having cycles of varying lengths across different fields, affording researchers the time and opportunity to pursue more novel, risky projects. After our research was reported on the Times Higher Education, Steven Hill – Head of Research Policy at HEFCE – raised concerns about our interpretation of the findings. Because older papers had more time to accumulate citations, information about them is more precise at that time, thus biasing the choice of older articles with higher citation counts.

Our research indicates that research output does indeed change around the time researchers are submitted to assessment exercises. This should allow departments with longer research cycles to pursue a more important research agenda. However, we actually observe a higher variance of quality in research published further from the deadline.

Title: The UK government is shedding some of its illusions about Brexit, and softening its position
Word count: 1040
Abstract: Step by step, the UK government is shedding some of its illusions about Brexit, argues Holger Schmieding (Berenberg). The United Kingdom has already accepted that it will have to meet the legally binding financial commitments it incurred while it was a member of the European Union (the so-called Brexit bill) and is going along with the EU's timetable for negotiations (divorce issues first, transition deal next, outlines of a future trade deal last). Last Friday saw another set of concessions being made by the Prime Minister

basic summary: Under such a deal, the UK would maintain access to the EU’s single market for goods and for some services on almost the same preferential terms as before. The only practical way in which Brexit could be reversed would be if early new elections swept a Labour-led government to power that might possibly call a new referendum. However, Theresa May is not yet close to such a deal that would minimise the economic damage to the UK.

If Theresa May continues to ditch one illusion after the other, making the UK position progressively more realistic without shattering her fractious government in the process, the UK may still end up with the semi-soft or soft Brexit that minimises the economic damage for the UK. As a result, any deal will reflect the bargaining position of the EU much more than the wishes of the UK government.

Third, as Ireland is the EU27 country most affected by Brexit, the EU has de facto granted Ireland a veto over the terms of any deal on post-Brexit relations which the EU27 can strike with the UK. On the most fundamental level, May does not yet seem to acknowledge three key facts: First, the medium-sized UK earns 12 per cent of its GDP through exports to the EU27 whereas the EU27 send exports worth merely 3 per cent of their GDP to the UK.

A new partnership body, Productivity UK, should also be established with the goal of raising firm-level productivity, including the acceleration of investment in automation technologies. Whereas past waves of automation typically required machines to have a clear set of instructions in structured environments to enable them to perform tasks once done by humans, today’s machines can act without explicit instruction in complex environments.

Title: Will Polish nationals feel at home in Scotland after Brexit?
Word count: 1297
Abstract: How does it feel to be a Polish national in Scotland after the EU referendum? Kate Botterill (Edinburgh Napier University) discusses how the result and subsequent uncertainty affected them, and the strategies they have adopted to deal with it. Post-Brexit, the Scottish Government want a different approach to migration from the rest of the UK, which may lead to stronger identification with Scotland among many Poles living in the country. Nonetheless, Scottish public attitudes towards migration appear to be hardening

basic summary: So even though so many people voted to remain, I’m looking at the streets and I feel anger and I feel hatred… And I have an accent. Given these challenges, will changing Scotland’s narrative on migration be enough to make EU citizens feel at home? This research raises key questions about how Polish nationals are negotiating belonging in Scotland through broader affiliations with Europe, and often away from Poland. When it comes to migration, Scotland is widely considered to be on a different political journey to the rest of the UK.

Title: The crisis in social care is connected to the gendered inadequacy of labour law
Word count: 1218
Abstract: Lydia Hayes writes that social care is a feminist issue. Highlighting some of the appalling conditions that care workers tolerate, she explains how employment law fails to protect women's employment and to value feminised labour. She concludes that unless social care provision is revolutionised, women will have little choice but to serve as unpaid carers: stuck at home, excluded from public life, and denied life choices

basic summary: Until the wages of care workers are free from sexist devaluation, and until the work of care workers is fully recognised, the labour of all women is devalued. The inadequacy of minimum wage law The financial crisis of 2007/2008 heralded UK labour market changes in which care work became the largest source of low-waged work for women. Care workers are failed by the current right to a minimum wage where their work is not recognised as ‘work’ for the purposes of statutory pay protection.

sim_matrix summary: When the social care minimum wage scandal of 2017 highlighted that thousands of care workers were paid nothing more than pocket-money to ensure the overnight well-being of vulnerable adults, employers were outraged that they should have to pay care workers what was legally owed. Until the wages of care workers are free from sexist devaluation, and until the work of care workers is fully recognised, the labour of all women is devalued. If we continue to tolerate care workers being employed to work without pay, the future of care work will be based on sexist expectations that care work should be done for free.

text_rank summary: Although the right to a minimum wage was supposed to prevent exploitation, it has become standard industry practice for care workers to work for free during increasingly large parts of each working day.A sex- based ideology about women’s subservience to the needs of others still circulates in the contemporary labour market, and minimum wage law does not do enough to assert the value of care work.If we continue to tolerate care workers being employed to work without pay, the future of care work will be based on sexist expectations that care work should be done for free.

Title: High prices, not waste or over-use, drive high health care costs in the US
Word count: 881
Abstract: The US spends nearly 18 percent of its GDP on health care, making it a real outlier among high-income countries in this area. But what is behind this unusually high level of health care spending? Irene Papanicolas investigates common beliefs about why spending is so high, including that US residents use more health care services, have poorer quality of care, and use 'too much' inpatient care. She finds that higher costs in the US are largely driven by higher prices across a wide range of health care services such as surgical procedures and drugs, as well as administrative complexity and costs

Evidence: The US has among the lowest proportion of health care spending on inpatient services (19 percent) and among the highest for outpatient services (42 percent). While low social spending may contribute to poorer population health outcomes, it is unlikely a primary driver of higher health care spending. Belief 1: The US spends more than other countries because US residents consume much more health care services.

Title: How we can preserve assisted housing in the context of gentrification and constrained federal resources
Word count: 1239
Abstract: Like many American cities, Washington DC is experiencing a squeeze in its affordable housing: population increases and declining stocks of government subsidized housing are making it harder for low-income households to find somewhere to live. In new research, Kathryn Howell looks at how existing assisted housing in Washington, DC is being preserved in the face of gentrification and funding challenges. She writes that preservation is a long and complex process that engages diverse stakeholders from tenants and tenant organizers to local and federal agency staff

basic summary: This case offers powerful support for increased collaboration between stakeholders and meaningful local laws and flexible funding for the preservation of affordable housing. But developing new funding sources and programs for the complex process of preservation requires multiple private and government stakeholders, shared governance and access to data. She writes that preservation is a long and complex process that engages diverse stakeholders from tenants and tenant organizers to local and federal agency staff.

These stakeholders used a mix local policies, including local tenant protections, flexible funding sources such as DC’s Housing Production Trust Fund, and laws that enabled access to the housing market such as the Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act, which gives tenants the right of first refusal when their building is for sale. One example of the process for preservation and loss is Museum Square Apartments in Washington, DC.

Title: Book review: colonial coptivity during the First World War: internment and the fall of the German empire, 1914-1919 by Mahon Murphy
Word count: 1221
Abstract: In Colonial Captivity during the First World War: Internment and the Fall of the German Empire, 1914-1919, Mahon Murphy offers a comprehensive study of the experiences of the 20,000 Germans in colonies who spent in time in Allied captivity during World War One.

basic summary: Networks of women play a central role in the history of women’s education and work, from suffrage to upper-middle-class women’s philanthropic connections. First, Fara gives us some hints of changing views on women, but does not discuss the development of knowledge produced by women in the social sciences.

Title: A coercive policy-making state? How the EU is alienating its citizens
Word count: 1284
Abstract: The remit of EU institutions has expanded inexorably, writes Jeremy Richardson, all while their policy-making style has shifted from a consensus-based process towards a more coercive, top-down one. At the same time, the EU's focus on interest groups might have also exacerbated the problem of the democratic deficit by distancing the EU from broader public opinion. These realities have contributed to both Brexit and the broader 'populist revolt' across Member States

Title: Critical actors and abortion law: a group of individuals in Northern Irish politics obstructs change
Word count: 965
Abstract: There are various reasons why progress on legal abortion in Northern Ireland has been blocked over the years. Key among them is that individual politicians rule out any suggestion of change, writes Jennifer Thomson. She argues that more attention should be given to the actions of individual actors, considering their role can often be as important as that of political parties or institutions

basic summary: Feminist political scientists have long employed the concept of ‘critical actors’ to refer to key individuals who instigate positive change within political institutions. Attempts to change abortion policy at the moment are also not helped by the fact that Northern Ireland is facing one of its most challenging political periods in decades. When considering why some policies are difficult to change, or even to implement at all, consideration must be given to the actions of individual members of political institutions.

Title: In Congressional races, political networks play an important role in ensuring minority representation
Word count: 1198
Abstract: A number of retirements in Congress ahead of the 2018 midterms have opened up the possibility for increased Latino representation in the US House of Representatives. But, the past has shown that Latino candidates aren't always selected for, or win elections in, majority Latino districts and that Latinos and non-Latinos who are elected don't always represent the views of their constituents. In new research, Angela X. Ocampo finds that political networks have a large influence on whether a Latino or non-Latino gets onto the ballot as a candidate. These networks are also often able to push candidates forward based on their legislative priorities, which may or may not align with the preferences of their constituents
basic similarity: 0.527161883329931
basic summary: This article is based on the paper The Wielding Influence of Political Networks: Representation in Majority- Latino Districts in Political Research Quarterly (PRQ). Lastly, the evidence showed that lack of coordination and fragmentation among existent political networks paved the way for the emergence of non-Latino candidates in majority-Latino districts. Political networks were also critical in narrowing down candidate fields when announced Latino and non-Latino candidates might weaken the chances of one another. The dataset included vote turns, candidate and district demographics and financial contributions made by the candidates themselves, individuals, parties and groups.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.4798051111031648
sim_matrix summary: Political networks were also critical in narrowing down candidate fields when announced Latino and non-Latino candidates might weaken the chances of one another. I investigated the activities of political networks in majority-Latino districts to understand why some districts are able to elect Latino representatives and some are not. I also compiled a dataset of the Latino and non-Latino candidates running in all open-seat congressional races from 2004 to 2014 that had a Latino population plurality. All of this suggests that political networks matter a great deal in shaping Latino descriptive and substantive representation.

text_rank summary: Political networks were also critical in narrowing down candidate fields when announced Latino and non-Latino candidates might weaken the chances of one another.For example, the evidence from Arizona’s 7th congressional district clearly showed that the candidates who were running in this district were supported by very different factions of the Democratic Party with distinct policy agendas.The dataset included vote turns, candidate and district demographics and financial contributions made by the candidates themselves, individuals, parties and groups.Obtained through a simulation from one of my models, Figure 1 below shows the predicted probability of a Latino candidate winning in a majority- Latino open-seat as a function of contributions from committees and parties, versus individual-level contributions, while holding all other candidate and district level variables constant.

Gary Miller (R) in California’s 31st Congressional district in 2012. Obtained through a simulation from one of my models, Figure 1 below shows the predicted probability of a Latino candidate winning in a majority- Latino open-seat as a function of contributions from committees and parties, versus individual-level contributions, while holding all other candidate and district level variables constant. But, the past has shown that Latino candidates aren’t always selected for, or win elections in, majority Latino districts and that Latinos and non-Latinos who are elected don’t always represent the views of their constituents. However, as Rep. Green’s case in Texas 29th Congressional district suggests, it is not always the case that a Latino representative achieves victory in a district with a large Latino constituency.

Title: The rhetorical attacks against the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School illustrate the breakdown of civil discourse in US politics
Word count: 1231
Abstract: In the wake of the tragic shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida on February 14th, many of the school's students have pushed hard for more stringent gun control legislation, only to be met with vitriolic attacks from the right, often accusing them of being 'crisis actors'. Ben Margulies writes that the treatment of these students echoes the way whites treat non-white political opponents: often as ‘enemies’ or ‘aliens’ who are unworthy of civil discourse

basic summary: Ben Margulies writes that the treatment of these students echoes the way whites treat non-white political opponents: often as ‘enemies’ or ‘aliens’ who are unworthy of civil discourse. There is little new to say about the United States’ unique gun culture, or about the grievous impact that this culture has on public safety in the country.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.3262029488710288
sim_matrix summary: What is new – at least among white American students – is the wave of gun-control activism that has swept American schools, including Douglas itself. To put it another way, in moments of extreme polarization, each political camp may start treating its opponents as enemy combatants, rather than fellow citizens, and in the United States, such treatment is likely to echo – however distantly – the way whites treat non-white political opponents.
text_rank similarity: 0.26286839442135457
text_rank summary: Even in a country as polarised as the United States, it is surprising to see adults attack children simply for taking the opposing side in a political dispute.Rather, Traverso’s writings, and the experience of American racial violence, serve more as an analogy for how polarization and breakdown can strip away the protections and respect we would normally accord to fellow citizens, especially those deemed worth of some special protection, like schoolchildren.

Title: Where are Kampala's missing houses?
Word count: 1040
Abstract: Kampala is facing a dearth of affordable formal housing. Rural-urban migration, limited access to mortgage finance, and a host of other factors are all straining its housing sector. It is imperative for planners to think of innovative and sustainable ways to address this issue, argue Astrid Haas and Thierry Hoza Ngoga

Title: EU students at UK universities: patterns and trends
Word count: 624
Abstract: What Brexit will mean for UK universities varies from institution to institution. Much data on Brexit's impact focuses on sector-wide aggregates, the forest that hides the trees. The UK provides excellent teaching and research, as illustrated by the number of its universities ranked in the top 10, 50 or 100 in the world. Yet despite its world-class reputation, the UK's higher education sector is hierarchical, and various layers will be affected differently. Ludovic Highman (UCL) explores the sector’s diversity in this regard
basic similarity: 0.35516927936380516
basic summary: Currently they are treated as home students, but in all likelihood EU students enrolling in the UK after its withdrawal in March 2019 will be treated as overseas students. The diversity of the student fabric of UK universities, so crucial to the overall student experience, depends on a healthy number of non-UK based students interacting with domestic students. Scottish universities are attractive to non-UK EU students in absolute numbers, with Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen attracting more than Oxbridge and competing with the top London universities. EU students graduate from rigorous secondary school systems and their drive to study abroad, most often in a language that is not theirs, makes them attractive to UK universities. It is possible that higher concentrations of EU students will further relocate to Scotland, though this depends on the level of fees charged beyond 2020.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.3906230148169304
sim_matrix summary: Under the current tuition fee system, Scottish universities will remain attractive to prospective EU students, while many of their English counterparts (outside London and Oxbridge) that already have lower proportions of EU students will be less attractive if non-UK EU students lose their current status, comparatively-speaking. The tuition fee regime seems to have an impact on the choice of destination, as suggested by the high numbers and ratios of EU students in Scottish universities, while London as a global city attracts the most EU students. While the London Russell Group universities have the highest numbers of non-UK EU students (with UCL ahead, followed by King’s), and Oxbridge remains firmly cemented within the top 10, the data also demonstrate the attractiveness of Scottish universities, and the subsequent relative drop in the number of non-UK EU students in English universities that are not located in global cities such as Birmingham, London, or Manchester, or academic powerhouses such as Oxford and Cambridge. EU students tend to enrol in Russell Group universities. This is partly explained by the lack of tuition fees for non- UK EU students in Scotland.

Abstract: In How to be a Geek: Essays on the Culture of Software, Matthew Fuller explores the bits and bytes that have reshaped our world through a collection of essays that examines the figure of the geek and software cultures.

This is not a book for software developers looking for a critical perspective on software culture; How To Be a Geek is about the geek, not for the geek, and its goal is to shed some light on software culture for an academic audience, ideally one with some knowledge of social theorists like Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze.

Title: Finding a way out of the Catalan labyrinth
Word count: 1496
Abstract: Almost four months after regional elections, Catalonia still has no government, and there is no end in sight in the stand-off over Catalan independence. Astrid Barrio and Bonnie N. Field write that there remain major international and judicial impediments to forming a new government, as well as notable splits in opinion within the pro-independence movement on the best strategy to pursue. And with political actors reaching an impasse, street protests and direct action initiatives have started to fill the vacuum

basic summary: What’s more, Spain’s government does not consider a hypothetical government, led by Puigdemont from afar, to be an effective government. That debate was urgently convened when the court ordered Turull, other accused members of the former government, and former parliamentary speaker Carme Forcadell to appear in court. The Catalan independence movement has seized upon this to again propose Sánchez’s candidacy, pending a court ruling, with the investiture debate set for 13 April.

Title: The more revisions a paper undergoes, the greater its subsequent recognition in terms of citations
Word count: 1222
Abstract: Is the peer review process simply a means by which errors are identified and corrected? Or is it a process in which a more constructive dialogue can take place and reviewers and editors may actively contribute to the text? John Rigby, Deborah Cox and Keith Julian have studied the published articles of a social sciences journal and found that the more revisions a paper undergoes, the greater its subsequent recognition in terms of citations

basic summary: Peer review needs to be recognised not as an event but as a process, often a long one, and one in which a constructive dialogue can take place. Our paper is part of a long-running effort to open the “black box” of peer review. Our work throws up an interesting paradox – at least an interesting paradox for those who hold that peer review is error correction.

Title: It's not enough for research to be useful to policy actors, we must try to actually influence change
Word count: 1544
Abstract: There is no doubt that good communications and framing research and evidence for your audience is important to influencing policy and having research impact. But shouldn't we be aiming higher than producing and packaging research that simply meets the demands of policy actors? Surely what we actually want to do is influence change, not reinforce social and political norms? James Georgalakis argues that research and researchers need to challenge dominant paradigms and expose inconvenient truths. Relationships, networks, and bodies of knowledge play a far more significant role in change processes than short-term communications campaigns on specific research reports

basic summary: The first is the simple one favoured by research donors and think tanks that says that research, if packaged correctly, can directly “enlighten” policy actors. We try and overcome academics’ nervousness about policy engagement by demonstrating that research rigour and policy engagement can be mutually reinforcing. However, another model describes how by trying to shape research and evidence for policy we may actually allow politics to shape knowledge. Academics’ anxiety over engaging in policy, which can sometimes seem very inconvenient, centres less on the issue of measurement and more on the fundamental relationship between evidence and policy. The semi-professional disciplines of both policy influence and research impact always attract the communications crowd.

Title: We need more carrots: give academic researchers the support and incentives to share data
Word count: 1120
Abstract: Making data available for other researchers to find, use, reuse, and reproduce is fundamental to open science, and ultimately makes research more efficient and effective. Yet despite funder policies that encourage and require data sharing, researchers in both the UK and the US report lower percentages of data sharing than the global average. In addition to progressive policies, Grace Baynes suggests researchers should be given incentives, expert support, training, and the infrastructure to make it seamless and easy to share data, and worth their while. Governments, funders, research institutions, libraries, and publishers all have a role to play to unlock the huge potential of research data

Title: The neurotic academic: how anxiety fuels casualised academic work
Word count: 1380
Abstract: As higher education undergoes a process of marketisation in the UK and the activities of academic staff are increasingly measured and scrutinised, universities are suffused with anxiety. Coupled with pressures facing all staff, casualised academics face multiple forms of insecurity. While anxiety is often perceived as an individual problem for which employees are encouraged to take personal responsibility, Vik Loveday argues that anxiety amongst academic staff should be understood in two ways: as a symptom of casualised work in an increasingly competitive environment; and as a tactic of governance, ensuring compliance
basic similarity: 0.42852256777736447
basic summary: This blog post is based on the author’s article, “The neurotic academic: anxiety, casualisation, and governance in the neoliberalising university”, published in the Journal of Cultural Economy (DOI: 10.1080/17530350.2018.1426032). Anxiety, then, can be conceptualised as a kind of “tactic” of governance: fuelling hard work, a striving for so-called “excellence”, and the creation of obedient academic subjects. It will come as no surprise to those working in the UK’s higher education (HE) sector that universities are currently suffused with anxiety.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.4277521662824275
sim_matrix summary: Anxiety was one of the defining themes to emerge from the interviews, and – most obviously – the pervasiveness of anxiety appeared to be a kind of symptom of casualised employment within the increasingly competitive landscape of the neoliberalising sector. For those participants who had been working on multiple contracts for extended periods of time, fixed-term work had led to feelings of marginalisation and stress in the workplace and – in some serious cases – mental ill-health. In addition to pressures facing many staff in universities – such as time- management, meeting growing employer expectations, and the evaluation of performance – “casualised” contracts present particular challenges for those facing employment uncertainty: in a material sense, this can be a case of keeping up with regular payments for rent and bills, or providing for dependents; on a day-to-day basis, time is spent juggling existing contracts with job applications and interviews, whilst acknowledging that planning for the future often seems unthinkable – even farcical – in the face of the unknown.
text_rank similarity: 0.4231945097692811
text_rank summary: Far from providing convenient flexibility, the participants in my research felt as though they had very little control over their working lives apart from the possibility of “working on the self” – taking personal responsibility for productivity, success, and “excellence” through the pursuit of student satisfaction, publications, or external funding, which was often achieved through chronic over-work fuelled by anxiety, but with no financial security or guarantee of permanent work at the end of contracts.While anxiety is quite clearly an effect of the conditions under which it is produced, during the project I began to turn my attention to what anxiety itself might be achieving: in the first instance, anxiety can be seen as a symptom of precarious work, which affected the participants on an individual basis; yet their narratives also pointed to the more active role that anxiety played in the quest to find work and the forging of an “entrepreneurial academic self” appropriate to the demands of an increasingly competitive sector.The “privatisation of stress” involves a shift from examining the wider conditions under which we labour to a focus on the self, and the stressed-out figure of the casualised “neurotic academic” points not only to the personal but also the political costs of failing to resist processes that are detrimental to the health of staff and the wellbeing of the public university.

Title: PhD students supervised collectively rather than individually are quicker to complete their theses
Word count: 1366
Abstract: Given the choice, most PhD students would prefer to receive individual supervision rather than be supervised alongside their peers as part of a collective. This is understandable, given the undivided attention and precise, directly relevant advice one would receive. However, Hans Agné and Ulf Mörkenstam have compared the experiences of individually and collectively supervised students on the same doctoral programme and found that collective supervision, during the first year at least, is correlated with significantly shorter times to thesis completion compared to individual supervision
basic similarity: 0.4428941621617673
basic summary: Studied in this way, it appears that collective supervision of first-year doctoral students is correlated with significantly shorter times to thesis completion compared to individual supervision. Students who received collective supervision in the first year averaged 57 months in the programme, while students receiving individual supervision averaged 92 months. Multivariate statistical analyses of these observations support the conclusion that collective supervision in the first year does indeed reduce the time to completion of doctoral students.

Studied in this way, it appears that collective supervision of first-year doctoral students is correlated with significantly shorter times to thesis completion compared to individual supervision. For example, it is well-known that time to doctoral completion depends on funding opportunities, the academic discipline, and the integration of doctoral students into ongoing research projects.

Title: Svexit or Huxit? How another country could follow the UK out of the EU
Word count: 1656
Abstract: What are the chances of another country following the UK out of the EU? Eurosceptics in other states may be emboldened by the deal the UK manages to secure, especially if it includes access to the Single Market. Moves to further EU integration could have a similar effect. Simon Hix (LSE) and Nick Sitter (Central European University) look at the cases of Hungary and Sweden
basic similarity: 0.3837329547673884
basic summary: A scenario that would see Sweden as the next country to leave the EU would have to involve a substantial change in the cross-party political consensus on European integration. The most realistic basis for such a scenario would involve the emergence of a model of European integration that is more attractive for Sweden than full EU membership. Should Brexit lead to a new model that is more attractive than the EEA, the benefits of EU membership might seem less obvious. Second, a successful soft Brexit could conceivably provide an attractive alternative to full EU membership.

sim_matrix summary: If Hungary loses EU subsidies, the benefits of EU membership (to the government) would be dramatically reduced. Having said that, support for the EU is volatile in both countries, and how Brexit plays out and how the EU responds internally to Brexit will influence the direction of travel for the publics and political parties in these two countries. Second, a successful soft Brexit could conceivably provide an attractive alternative to full EU membership. The most realistic basis for such a scenario would involve the emergence of a model of European integration that is more attractive for Sweden than full EU membership.

text_rank summary: A scenario that would see Sweden as the next country to leave the EU would have to involve a substantial change in the cross-party political consensus on European integration.A key difference between Britain and the next member state to leave is that the next exit is more likely to result from cold calculation of the costs and benefits of EU membership rather than a miscalculation by a prime minister and a country’s political establishment.A soft Brexit that leaves the UK with substantial access to the Single European Market, but does not cross Theresa May’s red lines in terms of budget contributions, free movement and the reach of the EU judiciary, might be the Conservative party’s dream for Britain.In the midst of the rather shambolic Brexit process, and with the growing recognition of the potentially huge economic costs of leaving the EU single market and customs union, it might seem an inopportune time to ask who will be next to leave the EU.

frequency summary: Even a “hard Brexit”, along the lines of a Canada-style free trade agreement with zero tariffs and zero quotas on goods, could provide a model for trade in goods that protect German carmakers’ presence in Hungary, and thus could allow Hungary to exit the EU without undue damage to one of its main expert industries. This “British model” may start to become attractive to some current member states, who may assume they could avoid some of the costs the UK has gone through in the Brexit process, and jump straight to the final settlement deal for the UK. However painful Brexit may seem for the UK in the short- or medium-term, once the relationship between the UK and EU has been partially settled (it will of course be an ongoing settlement), there will be a new “off the shelf” association for others to consider: a “British model”, in addition to the existing Norwegian, Swiss, Canadian, Turkish, Ukrainian, and so on. A soft Brexit that leaves the UK with substantial access to the Single European Market, but does not cross Theresa May’s red lines in terms of budget contributions, free movement and the reach of the EU judiciary, might be the Conservative party’s dream for Britain.

Title: Book review: fire and fury: inside the Trump White House by Michael Wolff
Word count: 1440
Abstract: With the overnight international bestseller Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, Michael Wolff utilises his ‘semipermanent seat’ on a West Wing sofa to offer an insider account of the Trump administration. While critical of Wolff’s writing style, methods and failure to separate clear falsehoods from certainties, Jonny Hall concedes that the book remains a gripping read that is at its most revealing when discussing the warring factions shaping Trump’s Presidency

basic summary: In sum, I would contend that this book is slightly more accurate than is generally being portrayed, but Wolff’s methods and writing style hardly aid his cause. This is one of the grievances of what Wolff or Trump might call the ‘mainstream media’: that Wolff’s book is simply ‘gossip’, and that ‘gossip isn’t journalism’.

text_rank similarity: 0.3796175181050702
text_rank summary: There is something to be said for Drew Margary’s view that Wolff’s book was only possible because of his different aims, but the willingness ‘to toss decorum aside and burn bridges’ hardly speaks to the critique of the author’s failure to offer any visible validity-based reflections.The note also includes the following: Many of the accounts of what has happened in the Trump White House are in conflict with one another; many, in Trumpian fashion, are baldly untrue.
tfidf similarity: 0.36993753933105467
tfidf summary: The book has become an international bestseller overnight, helped no doubt by the now-traditional Twitter explosion from President Donald Trump alongside the White House’s attempts to prevent the book’s publication – a la the Spycatcher affair in Britain in the 1980s. Where Wolff’s book is helpful sounds simplistic, but it is that it puts all of Trump’s blemishes in one place.

Title: Moving epidemic method (MEM) applied to virology data as a novel real time tool to predict peak in seasonal influenza healthcare utilisation. The Scottish experience of the 2017/18 season to date
Word count: 2802
Abstract: Scotland observed an unusual influenza A(H3N2)- dominated 2017/18 influenza season with healthcare services under significant pressure. We report the application of the moving epidemic method (MEM) to virology data as a tool to predict the influenza peak activity period and peak week of swab positivity in the current season. This novel MEM application has been successful locally and is believed to be of potential use to other countries for healthcare planning and building wider community resilience

basic summary: a Secondary care virology data refer to data from a secondary care electronic system that collates data from all Scottish laboratories for pathogens including influenza. We also tested the hypothesis that the timing would be the same regardless of influenza subtype by using all influenza seasons data (data not shown). Defining the start of a season We used the moving epidemic method (MEM) to define the epidemic threshold and identify the start of each influenza season.

Title: Students’ perceptions towards the integration of knowledge management processes in M-Learning Systems: A preliminary study
Word count: 283
Abstract: It is highly important for the higher educational institutions to understand the factors that affect the students’ acceptance of Mobile Learning (M-learning) systems as a prior step to the implementation of such systems. From the M-learningperspective, the literature ignores some f actors that could contribute to improve the knowledge acquisition, sharing, application, and protection, and how such factors could affect the M-learning acceptance. From the Knowledge Management (KM) perspective, research shows that KM processes have a positive impact on the acceptance an implementation of many Information Systems (IS). We observed that the existing literature overlooks the impact of KM processes on M-learning acceptance. Accordingly, the main objective of this study is to analyse the students’ perceptions towards the integration of KM processes in M-learning systems. A mixed method (questionnaire and interviews) was used for data collection. An online survey has been sent to IT undergraduate students in two different universities in two different regions namely, Universiti Malaysia Pahang (UMP) in Malaysia and Al Buraimi University College (BUC) in Oman. 305 students responded to the survey. Results indicated that around 74% of students reported that it is interesting to incorporate KM processes in M-learning systems. Additionally, results pointed out that 93% of the students indicated that they would use the M-learning system in their studies if all KM processes will be taken into consideration. It is imperative that these results will assist the M-learning systems developers to take these factors into their consideration while designing and developing such systems. Furthermore, educators may need to elaborate their teaching strategies in a way that suits ths use of these systems and meets the students’ needs

Title: Alzheimer disease pathology and the cerebrospinal fluid proteome.
Word count: 3988
Abstract: Altered proteome profiles have been reported in both postmortem brain tissues and body fluids of subjects with Alzheimer disease (AD), but their broad relationships with AD pathology, amyloid pathology, and tau-related neurodegeneration have not yet been fully explored. Using a robust automated MS-based proteomic biomarker discovery workflow, we measured cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomes to explore their association with well-established markers of core AD pathology.Cross-sectional analysis was performed on CSF collected from 120 older community-dwelling adults with normal (n = 48) or impaired cognition (n = 72). LC-MS quantified hundreds of proteins in the CSF. CSF concentrations of β-amyloid 1-42 (Aβ &lt;sub&gt;1-42&lt;/sub&gt; ), tau, and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (P-tau181) were determined with immunoassays. First, we explored proteins relevant to biomarker-defined AD. Then, correlation analysis of CSF proteins with CSF markers of amyloid pathology, neuronal injury, and tau hyperphosphorylation (i.e., Aβ &lt;sub&gt;1-42&lt;/sub&gt; , tau, P-tau181) was performed using Pearson's correlation coefficient and Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.We quantified 790 proteins in CSF samples with MS. Four CSF proteins showed an association with CSF Aβ &lt;sub&gt;1-42&lt;/sub&gt;  levels (p value ≤ 0.05 with correlation coefficient (R) ≥ 0.38). We identified 50 additional CSF proteins associated with CSF tau and 46 proteins associated with CSF P-tau181 (p value ≤ 0.05 with R ≥ 0.37). The majority of those proteins that showed such associations were brain-enriched proteins. Gene Ontology annotation revealed an enrichment for synaptic proteins and proteins originating from reelin-producing cells and the myelin sheath.We used an MS-based proteomic workflow to profile the CSF proteome in relation to cerebral AD pathology. We report strong evidence of previously reported CSF proteins and several novel CSF proteins specifically associated with amyloid pathology or neuronal injury and tau hyperphosphorylation

basic summary: Macular atrophy incidence in anti-vascular endothelial growth factor-treated neovascular age-related macular degeneration: risk factor evaluation for individualized treatment need of ranibizumab or aflibercept according to an observe-and-plan regimen. Multivariate analysis showed a significant association of the anti-VEGF retreatment need with antidepressant medication, month 3 CRT and month 3 PED height. A higher anti-VEGF treatment need was associated with anti- depressant medication use, despite the few patients on antide- pressant medication (n=19, 9.3% of eyes) in our multivariate analysis (p=0.027). that included month 3 CRT (corrected for the OCT machine/ study, p<0.0001), month 3 PED height (p=0.0014) and the intake of antidepressant medication (p=0.027) (table 2). This study investigated the relationship between the need for anti-VEGF retreatment in patients with nAMD and antidepressant medication, and the potential impact of ocular structural factors. Factors associated with recurrence of age- related macular degeneration after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment: a retrospective cohort study. They also required non-significantly more retreatment (mean number of injections: 16.0 (±6.06)) than patients without antidepressant medication (mean number of injections: 13.8 (±5.8)) (p=0.12). In conclusion, this study provided evidence that antidepres- sant medication influences anti-VEGF treatment requirement in patients with nAMD, possibly via the pro-VEGF effect of the medication, and/or depression status. Rapid antidepressant changes with sleep deprivation in major depressive disorder are associated with changes in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF): a pilot study.

AbsTrACT  background/Aims Vascular endothelial growth factor  (VEGF) is a key player in the pathogenesis of neovascular  age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and is also  involved in the final common pathway of antidepressant  medication. This retreatment need varies widely between  patients,4 for unclear reasons, from patients who  are refractory to the maximal monthly treatments  due to persistent or recurrent exudative fluid,5 to  those responding to a regimen with 3-monthly or  fewer injections, without recurrent exudation.4 6  The factors associated with anti-VEGF refracto- riness and the number of anti-VEGF retreatments  required are poorly understood. Conclusion This study provides evidence that treatment  with antidepressant medication increases the anti-VEGF  retreatment requirement in patients with nAMD, possibly  through the interplay of antidepressant medication,  depression status and VEGF levels. Multivariate analysis  revealed a significant association between anti-VEGF  retreatment requirement and antidepressant medication  use (p=0.027), as well as thicker central retinal thickness  at month 3 (p<0.0001) and month 3 PED height  (p=0.001). Additionally, we did not include sufficient information  on obstructive sleep apnoea9 or genetic polymorphisms for  analysis.8  Recently, we found that macular atrophy was more frequent  in patients needing fewer injections.24 This suggests a change  during the treatment course, from the pure neovascular form to  some atrophic changes, occurring with reduced VEGF produc- tion and a lower retreatment need. However,  this parameter was invariably linked to the study, the team and  the OCT machine used, and these grouped parameters were  associated with an increased treatment need in the study using  aflibercept and the Spectralis SD-OCT, perhaps due to the high  sensitivity of the Heidelberg Spectralis. Previous reports have described a strong relationship between  antidepressant response and VEGF, and its receptor activation in  the hippocampus.16–18 Patients with major depressive disorder,  presumably on antidepressant treatment, show higher serum  VEGF levels.21 22 Since choroidal neovessels are directly in  contact with the serum and since the retina is part of the central  nervous system, we hypothesised that a depression and/or anti- depressant-related VEGF increase might influence exudative  activity in nAMD and increase the anti-VEGF treatment need.

Title: Direct vocabulary instruction: The effects of contextualised word families on students’ vocabulary acquisition / Frankie Subon
Word count: 861
Abstract: The present study’s review on past studies in Malaysia reveals lexical paralysis as the main reason for students’ inability to master English as a second language. Notably, numerous studies found that direct vocabulary instruction is effective for increasing students’ vocabulary size while some studies found conflicting results. In addition, direct vocabulary instruction is not given serious attention and emphasis in a second language classroom. In view of all this, this study aimed to examine the impact of a rich, systematic, structured and principled Contextualised Word Family (CWF) Model of direct vocabulary instruction on students’ vocabulary size and guided essay writing test scores based on their proficiency levels. It also examined whether there was any significant difference in students’ vocabulary size before and after the treatment and significant difference between genders. Besides, the study also evaluated the relationships between students’ vocabulary size and their attitudes and perceived problems faced in vocabulary learning. This study employed a quasi-experimental design whereby the data collection was conducted in a normal classroom condition. 143 Form Two students from a secondary school in Samarahan district in Sarawak, Malaysia were selected as the respondents for this study using purposive and stratified random sampling

Notably, numerous studies found that direct vocabulary instruction is effective for increasing students’ vocabulary size while some studies found conflicting results. It also examined whether there was any significant difference in students’ vocabulary size before and after the treatment and significant difference between genders.

In conclusion, this study has provided empirical evidence on the alternative model of OCB in a school context, specifically in the Malaysian secondary school. Thus, this study has attempted to test and validate the alternative model for teachers’ OCB, known as The Teacher’s Triangular OCB Model. The results showed that principal support, meaningful work, and professional commitment were significant predictors of OCB.

Teachers are seen as   key players in fulfilling the demands of  high quality education especially teachers who are willing to demonstrate  extra-role behaviour which is termed as organisational citizenship  behaviour (OCB). Besides,  the study also evaluated the relationships between students’ vocabulary  size and their attitudes and perceived problems faced in vocabulary  learning. In view of all this, this study aimed to  examine the impact of a rich, systematic, structured and principled  Contextualised Word Family (CWF) Model of direct vocabulary  instruction on students’ vocabulary size and guided essay writing test  scores based on their proficiency levels. The results had generated  some vital significance and implications for instructional practices,  new knowledge in L2 vocabulary acquisition and recommendations  for future research.

Title: Predictors of Outcome after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction
Word count: 946
Abstract: An anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is one of the most common injuries to the knee joint. It is also one of the most researched areas within sports medicine, orthopedics and physical therapy. The goal of this thesis was to evaluate patient-related, surgery-related and injury-related factors that affect the outcome after an ACL reconstruction.This thesis comprises nine studies covering three themes: developing a foundation for research, short-term predictors and long-term predictors. The primary statistical methods used in this thesis were univariable and multivariable regression analyses with the various binary or continuous dependent outcomes.The first theme consists of two studies; a cross-sectional analysis of a rehabilitation outcome register, Project ACL, and a systematic review of the Scandinavian knee ligament registers. Based on the results of the study presenting Project ACL, patients who returned to knee-strenuous sport were characterized as having superior patient-reported knee function and a superior psychological state compared with patients who had not returned to knee-strenuous sport. Moreover, this study also illustrated the differences in results related to various definitions of return to sport. Modifiable factors identified in the Scandinavian knee ligament registers that favor superior patient-reported outcome include not smoking, pre- and postoperative specialized rehabilitation, using a hamstring tendon autograft and less time between ACL injury and reconstruction. The non-modifiable factors found in the registers that favor a superior patient-reported outcome included male sex, younger age and not having sustained a concomitant intra-articular injury.The second theme consists of five prospective studies based on the Swedish National Knee Ligament Register, Project ACL and a multicenter trial. This theme covered the short-term outcomes related to patient-reported knee function, achieving symmetrical knee function defined as a limb symmetry index of ≥ 90% in five tests of muscle function and return to sport. In terms of patient-related factors, male sex and younger age had a positive influence on returning to sport and patient-reported knee function in the short term, but not on recovering symmetrical knee function. In addition, a higher pre-injury level of physical activity was associated with returning to sport. In terms of surgery-related factors, the use of a hamstring tendon autograft had a positive effect on patient-reported knee function. Finally, patients who had sustained concomitant injuries appeared to run an increased risk of inferior outcome in patient-reported knee function and returning to sport after an ACL reconstruction.The third theme consists of two studies; an exploratory analysis of two randomized trials and a long-term analysis of the Swedish National Knee Ligament Register. This theme covered the long-term outcomes related to patient-reported knee function and the development of osteoarthritis, i.e. Kellgren-Lawrence grade ≥ 2. In terms of patient-related factors, a minor effect on long-term knee function and osteoarthritis appears to be related to patient characteristics. A lower preoperative body mass index may, however, be an important attribute in understanding which patients report better long-term knee function. Surgery-related factors showed no clinically relevant effect on the long-term outcomes that were studied. The presence of concomitant injuries appears to have a negative influence on the long-term outcome, where cartilage lesions in particular are risk factors for inferior knee function

Title: On dental caries and socioeconomy in Swedish children and adolescents - Clinical and register-based studies
Word count: 442
Abstract: The overall aim was to analyze the dental caries experience among Swedish children and adolescents and explore it with respect to demographic and socioeconomic factors. Study I is a longitudinal clinical study of 271 children, followed from three to six years of age (2003-6), with the aim to analyze initial and manifest caries in the primary dentition. Studies II–IV are cross-sectional registry studies of 300,988 children and adolescents, 3–19 years of age (2007-9). Study II investigated caries with reference to age, gender and geographical area. Study III explored the associations of individual multiple socioeconomic factors on the caries experience. Study IV analyzed the variability in caries experience at different area levels with respect to individual demography and socioeconomics. The results showed that young children with an early caries experience had a high risk of disease progression and initial carious lesions constituted a large share of the disease burden (Study I). Among 18- and 19-year-olds, only one-third had no manifest caries experience. The disease burden was highly skewed at all ages. Females had a higher risk of a caries experience than males before their teens, with a reverse pattern during the teenage years (Study II). Multiple socioeconomic factors had a significant association with the caries experience among children and adolescents, especially the youngest children (Study III). Small geographical areas explained more of the variance in caries experience compared with the more aggregated level dental clinics (Study IV). In conclusion, disparities in caries experience among Swedish children and adolescents were found with a skewed distribution, within age groups, between genders, between residential areas and in relation to individual socioeconomic status. The findings may serve as a basis for allocating resources in dentistry with the goal/ambition to achieve greater equity of dental health

Title: Essays on behavioral economics and the effects of the colonial rule on Java
Word count: 502
Abstract: This thesis consists of four chapters. While the first chapter is in the field of development economics, chapter two, three and four are in the field of behavioral economics using laboratory experiments. The first chapter analyzes the economic effects of the Dutch colonial rule on Java, Indonesia, with a special focus on female labor market outcomes. Chapter two, three and four have in common that they focus on how individuals access information when making decisions. In chapter two, the influence of additional information on the effectiveness of ethically certified goods on the purchasing decision of consumers is analyzed.Chapter three studies whether investment decisions differ between individuals and groups under two different environmental policy instruments. Finally, chapter four analyzes a situation where individuals might choose to ignore costless information in the setting of a finitely repeated prisoners’ dilemma game

basic summary: Keywords: coercive institutions, sugar cultivation, women empowerment, sex ratio JEL classification: N25, O1, O12 Do consumers choose to stay ignorant? This study finds that consumers do not ignore information about the effectiveness of ethical certificates in a systematic manner. We experimentally examine this option to remain ignorant about the time horizon in a finitely repeated two-person prisoners’ dilemma game. We confirm that pairs without horizon knowledge avoid the drop in cooperation that otherwise occurs toward the end of the game. However, this effect is superposed by cooperation declining more rapidly in pairs without horizon knowledge during the middle phase of the game. Second, on the basis of the existing literature, we hypothesize that this institutional shock might have affected current female empowerment through: an increase in female labor demand and supply.

However, this effect is superposed by cooperation declining more rapidly in pairs without horizon knowledge during the middle phase of the game. This holds for both, individual and group decisions but we find no evidence of an interaction effect. However, consumers are extremely price sensitive: once a small cost for information is introduced, most consumers are not willing to access it, and the share of consumers buying the certified product decreases significantly. Also, as long as the access to information is costless, varying the way it is provided to consumers does not influence the purchasing decision between a certified and an uncertified product.

Title: Fishing from the Shore: Exploring coastal transformations and changing life opportunities in an urban fishing community of India
Word count: 423
Abstract: This thesis explores changing life opportunities in an urban fishing community in the Global South, based on a case study of a village situated on the periphery of Mangalore, a swiftly growing, middlesized city in Karnataka state, India. During eight months of ethnographic fieldwork, I observed varying interpretations and active contestation around emerging urbanization, shifting interactions between land and water, and changing livelihood activities.Fishing from the Shore views urban fisheries as a component of socio-material entanglements on the coast.

Title: Teaching International Relations in Japan : How to Introduce the Yugoslav Civil War in a Culturally Diverse Classroom
Word count: 3066
Abstract: Japan’s higher educational environment has become progressively globalized. The number of international students has been steadily growing and in the university classrooms, students and teachers gather from almost all corners of the globe. In order to meet educational needs of both Japanese and foreign students, a globalized classroom necessitates different, more diversified pedagogical approaches. In the present article, I describe a model to teach about modern international conflicts in a multicultural teaching environment and present my personal experience in the application of the model when introducing undergraduate students at Josai University’s（JU） Faculty of Contemporary Policy Studies to the Yugoslav civil war during the 1990s.教育実践報

basic summary: Especially teaching and pedagogical as- pects necessitate a thorough reevaluation and specific tailoring to the learning needs and goals of international students. The number of international students has been steadily growing and in the university classrooms, students and teachers gather from almost all corners of the globe. Then I will present how I applied it in my course on selected topics in International Relations （IR） when teaching about the post-Cold War international conflicts. The six assump- tions include considerations about studentsʼ backgrounds, teaching content, active-reflective learning, studentsʼ values, pedagogical methods and interrelatedness of content, educational goals and instructional methods （Table 1）.

Title: Exploring variability in basal ganglia connectivity with functional MRI in healthy aging.
Word count: 3186
Abstract: Changes in functional connectivity (FC) measured using resting state fMRI within the basal ganglia network (BGN) have been observed in pathologies with altered neurotransmitter systems and conditions involving motor control and dopaminergic processes. However, less is known about non-disease factors affecting FC in the BGN. The aim of this study was to examine associations of FC within the BGN with dopaminergic processes in healthy older adults. We explored the relationship between FC in the BGN and variables related to demographics, impulsive behavior, self-paced tasks, mood, and motor correlates in 486 participants in the Whitehall-II imaging sub-study using both region-of-interest- and voxel-based approaches. Age was the only correlate of FC in the BGN that was consistently significant with both analyses. The observed adverse effect of aging on FC may relate to alterations of the dopaminergic system, but no unique dopamine-related function seemed to have a link with FC beyond those detectable in and linearly correlated with healthy aging

Title: Understanding low-pass-filtered Mandarin sentences: Effects of fundamental frequency contour and single-channel noise suppression
Word count: 3266
Abstract: The present work assessed the effects of flattening the fundamental frequency (F0) contour and processing by single-channel noise suppression on the intelligibility of low-pass (LP)-filtered (LPF) sentences. The original F0 contour was replaced by an average flat F0 contour or treated by single-channel noise suppression, followed by application of LP filtering to Mandarin sentences. Processed stimuli were presented to normal-hearing listeners to recognize. Flattening the F0 contour significantly affected the understanding of LPF sentences. Noise suppression by existing single-channel algorithms did not improve the intelligibility of LPF sentences
basic similarity: 0.7125693444987129
basic summary: The present work specially assessed the effects of two manipulations (i.e., flattening the 71 F0 contour and processing by single-channel noise suppression) on the intelligibility of LPF 72 sentences. The original F0 contour was replaced by an average flat F0 contour 31 or treated by single-channel noise suppression, followed by application of LP filtering to Mandarin 32 sentences. The F0 contour plays 237 an important role in understanding LPF sentences and may be redundant to the low-frequency 238 information on the intelligibility of full-spectrum speech. The F0 75 contour is an important acoustic cue for lexical tone identification and speech understanding in 76 adverse conditions (e.g., Chen et al., 2014; Nie et al., 2005). Speech material comprised sentences extracted from the 97 Mandarin Hearing in Noise Test (MHINT) database (Wong et al., 2007).

Title: Separating Risk Assessment from Risk Management Poses Legal and Ethical Problems in Person-Centred Care.
Word count: 1646
Abstract: : Accelerating progress in screening technologies, e.g. genetic testing, means more individuals are facing the stressful decision of whether to request the test. Fully-informed and preference-based consent, as well as ethical practice, requires the full range of benefits and harms from any test or treatment to be identified and assessed from the individual's point of view. For both ethical and legal reasons, we see the decision on whether to undertake a genetic screening test being increasingly seen, in future, as calling for a personalised analysis of the full range of subsequent management options. The conventional dissociation of 'risk assessment' and 'risk management' phases is thereby ruled out. One way of addressing the resulting challenge is through personalised multi-criterial decision support tools. In this vision paper we provide conceptual proof of method of how such an interactive online tool could function. The polygenetic genetic screening decision is used, solely as illustration.<br/

Separating an initial risk assessment phase from a subsequent risk management phase (on the basis of a now known assessment) also interferes with the autonomy of the person. In one, the person has already had a risk assessment, such as one based on family history, and their probability of breast cancer from this test is available. It biases their information processing, through focusing the decision making on the criteria measured in the risk assessment, often a single outcome such as risk of developing breast cancer. Management analysis for average risk The person enters their criterion weightings and option burden ratings. Whether to have a risk assessment can therefore only be satisfactorily answered in the light of a full multi-criterial management analysis.

Title: Ownership in Name, But not Necessarily in Action; Comment on “It’s About the Idea Hitting the Bull’s Eye”: How Aid Effectiveness Can Catalyse the Scale-up of Health Innovations”
Word count: 1935
Abstract: A recently-published paper by Wickremasinghe et al assesses the scalability of pilot projects in three countries using the aid effectiveness agenda as an analytical framework. The authors report uneven progress and recommend applying aid effectiveness principles to improve the scalability of projects. This commentary focuses on one key principle of aid effectiveness – country ownership; it describes difficulties in defining and achieving it, and provides practical steps donors and recipient governments can take to move forward towards country ownership
basic similarity: 0.3289268657624402
basic summary: Even taking country to mean government ownership, academics and practitioners are still faced with the problem of how to assess whether a government has ownership. Finally, until recently, discussions on ownership have centred around government ownership of their development priorities, which donors subsequently support. Second, there are tensions between achieving the principles of ownership and managing for results - an aid effectiveness principle that Wickremasinghe et al surprisingly did not assess.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.4348278548702967
sim_matrix summary: What this has meant in reality in countries like Tanzania  and Malawi, is that to meet the principle of ownership the  government held separate budgetary meetings with donors,  but then still made their decisions behind closed doors; the  donors could report on these meetings as meeting ownership,  but this created a whole parallel system of accounting for  resources which was not government-led and did not reflect  Martinez-Alvarez International Journal of Health Policy and Management, 2018, x(x), 1–32 the priorities of the recipient government.3,5 In all cases  (including the Paris Declaration), government leadership is  seen as essential to country ownership (also to alignment and  harmonisation1,3,6). Donors  and recipient governments need to make meaningful changes  to their approach to managing external and domestic funds  in the health sector in order to achieve country ownership,  which is particularly relevant in light of current demands for  increased domestic spending on health.2   What Is Ownership? Sector-wide approaches were  seen as vehicles to achieving the aid effectiveness agenda.3  Studies have shown, however, that pressures to achieve and  show results have contributed to donors abandoning these  approaches in favour of vertical projects, sometimes managed  by non-government actors.3,7 One step towards relieving  tensions between ownership and accounting for results  would be to have one criterion for evaluation of projects be  the extent to which they are aligned within recipient country  health systems.

Wickremasinghe  and colleagues acknowledge such trust needs time for donors  to engage in a dialogue with the recipient countries, something  that donor programmes often lack, but also that donors have  become frustrated with governments, something that has been  reported in a cross-country study of funding modalities that  found that donors were increasingly disbursing aid projects  outside of government.7 In addition, it is important to consider  who should be the implementers of donor projects. As the  examples in Wickremasinghe et al show, strong government  leadership and a willingness to engage with donors, will  empower governments to take charge of their development  strategies.1 In addition, it is as important that recipient  governments are also transparent about the way they use  funds, both domestic and external, and are also predictable  both in making long term plans, and in disbursing committed  funds.

Title: Wicked problems and a 'wicked' solution.
Word count: 1563
Abstract: 'Wicked' is the term used to describe some of the most challenging and complex issues of our time, many of which threaten human health. Climate change, biodiversity loss, persisting poverty, the advancing obesity epidemic, and food insecurity are all examples of such wicked problems. However there is a strong body of evidence describing the solutions for addressing many of these problems. Given that much is known about how many of these problems could be addressed - and given the risks of not acting - what will it take to create the 'tipping point' needed for effective action?  A recent (2015) court ruling in The Hague held that the Dutch government's stance on climate change was illegal, ordering them to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 25% within 5 years (by 2020), relative to 1990 levels. The case was filed on behalf of 886 Dutch citizens, suing the government for violating human rights and climate changes treaties by failing to take adequate action to prevent the harmful impacts of climate change. This judicial ruling has the potential to provide a way forward, inspiring other civil movements and creating a template from which to address other wicked problems.  This judicial strategy to address the need to lower greenhouse gas emissions in the Netherlands is not a magic bullet, and requires a particular legal and institutional setting. However it has the potential to be a game-changer - providing an example of a strategy for achieving domestic regulatory change that is likely to be replicable in some countries elsewhere, and providing an example of a particularly 'wicked' (in the positive, street-slang sense of the word) strategy to address seemingly intractable and wicked problems

Conclusion: This judicial strategy to address the need to lower greenhouse gas emissions in the Netherlands is not a magic bullet, and requires a particular legal and institutional setting. Landmark court ruling tells Dutch government to do more on climate change.

tfidf summary: How- ever the ruling does provide an example of a strategy for achieving domestic regulatory change that is likely to be replicable in some countries elsewhere. Urgenda, an environmental non- profit organisation, filed the case on behalf of 886 Dutch citizens, suing the government for violating human rights by failing to take adequate action to prevent the harmful impacts of climate change [8, 9]. Given that much is known about how many of these problems could be addressed – and given the risks of not acting – what will it take to create the ‘tipping point’ needed for effective action? Main text We may not have to wait for the respective apocalypses. Main body: A recent (2015) court ruling in The Hague held that the Dutch government’s stance on climate change was illegal, ordering them to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 25% within 5 years (by 2020), relative to 1990 levels. Conclusion: This judicial strategy to address the need to lower greenhouse gas emissions in the Netherlands is not a magic bullet, and requires a particular legal and institutional setting. Given the threat posed by climate change, the ruling included that cutting emission by a lesser among of 14% to 17% by 2020, as were the government plans at the time, was unlawful. Public health experts have often suggested that addressing wicked problems affecting health will ultim- ately require government regulation and that, given gov- ernmental reluctance to act, and short of catastrophe, the impetus for such regulation will come from civil society [10]. Climate change, biodiversity loss, persisting poverty, the advancing obesity epidemic, and food insecurity are all examples of such wicked problems.

Title: An inexpensive open source 3D-printed membrane feeder for human malaria transmission studies.
Word count: 3473
Abstract: The study of malaria transmission requires the experimental infection of mosquitoes with Plasmodium gametocytes. In the laboratory, this is achieved using artificial membrane feeding apparatus that simulate body temperature and skin of the host, and so permit mosquito feeding on reconstituted gametocyte-containing blood. Membrane feeders either use electric heating elements or complex glass chambers to warm the infected blood; both of which are expensive to purchase and can only be sourced from a handful of specialized companies. Presented and tested here is a membrane feeder that can be inexpensively printed using 3D-printing technology.  Using the Plasmodium falciparum laboratory strain NF54, three independent standard membrane feeding assays (SMFAs) were performed comparing the 3D-printed feeder against a commercial glass feeder. Exflagellation rates did not differ between the two feeders. Furthermore, no statistically significant difference was found in the oocyst load nor oocyst intensity of Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes (mean oocyst range 1.3-6.2 per mosquito; infection prevalence range 41-79%).  Open source provision of the design files of the 3D-printed feeder will facilitate a wider range of laboratories to perform SMFAs in laboratory and field settings, and enable them to freely customize the design to their own requirements

Title: Misidentification of Burkholderia pseudomallei as Acinetobacter species in northern Thailand.
Word count: 1941
Abstract: Burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of melioidosis, a disease endemic throughout the tropics.  A study of reported Acinetobacter spp. bacteraemia was performed at Chiang Rai provincial hospital from 2014 to 2015. Isolates were collected and tested for confirmation.  A total of 419 putative Acinetobacter spp. isolates from 412 patients were re-identified and 5/419 (1.2%) were identified as B. pseudomallei. Four of the five patients with melioidosis died. An estimated 88/419 (21%) isolates were correctly identified as Acinetobacter spp.  Misidentification of Acinetobacter spp. as B. pseudomallei or other bacteria is not uncommon and programmes to address these shortfalls are urgently required

Even in endemic areas, microbiology laboratories can struggle to iden- tify B. pseudomallei.Keywords: Acinetobacter, Burkholderia pseudomallei, laboratory quality assurance, melioidosis, misidentiﬁcation Introduction Burkholderia pseudomallei, an environmental Gram-negative bacterium, is the causative agent of melioidosis.1 There are an estimated 165 000 human cases with 89 000 deaths annually worldwide.2 It is thought to be endemic in northern Thailand; how- ever, only sporadic reports have emerged to date.2 Transmission occurs through percutaneous inoculation, inhalation or aspiration.1 Risk factors include diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, chronic lung dis- ease and chronic kidney disease.3 Clinical misdiagnosis of melioidosis regularly occurs due to its protean manifestations, ranging from mild fever to fatal septic shock.1,3 Diagnosis is typically made by culture of clinical specimens and identiﬁcation of B. pseudomallei using conventional microbio- logical techniques including Gram stain, oxidase test, biochemical tests and antibiotic susceptibility tests.4,5 Additionally, latex agglu- tination, identiﬁcation kits (e.g.The initial empirical treatment in these patients included IV cef- triaxone or IV piperacillin/tazobactam with additional antibiotics in some cases (e.g.Training and introduction of a simple laboratory algorithm have been shown to be effective in diag- nosing melioidosis in Vietnam.4 During the study period, nine other patients had melioidosis diagnosed from positive blood cultures, demonstrating that local laboratory staff are capable of identifying B. pseudomallei, albeit inconsistently.Following discus- sions with local stakeholders, plans are under way to provide additional training, improve quality assurance and introduce consistent use of new diagnostics (e.g., latex agglutination test, API20NE and VITEK) within the microbiology laboratory.In addition, this study shows that data from routine laboratory-based sur- veillance systems, even in countries like Thailand with relatively well-developed health care facilities, should be treated with caution.Clinical blood culture isolates originally identiﬁed as Acinetobacter spp.

Keywords: Acinetobacter, Burkholderia pseudomallei, laboratory quality assurance, melioidosis, misidentiﬁcation Introduction Burkholderia pseudomallei, an environmental Gram-negative bacterium, is the causative agent of melioidosis.1 There are an estimated 165 000 human cases with 89 000 deaths annually worldwide.2 It is thought to be endemic in northern Thailand; how- ever, only sporadic reports have emerged to date.2 Transmission occurs through percutaneous inoculation, inhalation or aspiration.1 Risk factors include diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, chronic lung dis- ease and chronic kidney disease.3 Clinical misdiagnosis of melioidosis regularly occurs due to its protean manifestations, ranging from mild fever to fatal septic shock.1,3 Diagnosis is typically made by culture of clinical specimens and identiﬁcation of B. pseudomallei using conventional microbio- logical techniques including Gram stain, oxidase test, biochemical tests and antibiotic susceptibility tests.4,5 Additionally, latex agglu- tination, identiﬁcation kits (e.g. However, earlier initiation of appropriate antibiotics alone, without timely and adequate intensive care support, may not improve the outcome in severe disease.3 Empirical ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam were used: ceftriaxone has moderate in vitro activity against B. pseudomallei, while susceptibility to piperacillin/tazobactam has also been shown.6,7 Despite these ﬁndings, ceftriaxone is less effective than ceftazidime and clinical experience with piperacil- lin/tazobactam is limited.8 Correct identiﬁcation on admission blood culture might have improved the outcome in one patient where appropriate treatment was delayed for 4 d. Even in endemic areas, microbiology laboratories can struggle to iden- tify B. pseudomallei. Admission blood cultures were reported within 22–40 h of collection as Acinetobacter spp., while antibiotic susceptibility results were reported 16–24 h later. Training and introduction of a simple laboratory algorithm have been shown to be effective in diag- nosing melioidosis in Vietnam.4 During the study period, nine other patients had melioidosis diagnosed from positive blood cultures, demonstrating that local laboratory staff are capable of identifying B. pseudomallei, albeit inconsistently. Clinical summaries of the ﬁve misidentiﬁed melioidosis cases are presented in Table 1 and details of the blood culture results for each patient in Table 2. Four cases had severe disease, were elderly, developed multi-organ failure and died (patients 1, 2, 4 and 5). Treatment involves an intensive phase with intravenous (IV) cef- tazidime or meropenem for 10–14 d followed by an eradication phase of 3–6 months with oral co-trimoxazole or co-amoxiclav.1 Here we report ﬁve culture-conﬁrmed cases whose B. pseudomal- lei had been misidentiﬁed as Acinetobacter spp.

Title: Preference-Sensitive Apomediative Decision Support Is Key to Facilitating Self-Produced Health.
Word count: 2332
Abstract: In the health capital model, the main function of health services is not to produce health, but to support the person in their self-production investments. In the health context there are three types of decision support tools, depending on the role of the provider (e.g. clinician) and person. Non-mediative tools are designed to help the clinician decide what is best for the patient. Intermediative Patient Decision Aids are designed to help the clinician and patient decide together, in an encounter, what is best for the patient. Apomediative Personalised Decision Support Tools are designed to help the person decide what is best for themselves, including whether to seek a professional consultation and/or to prepare for, and engage in, an intermediative consultation. Only preference-sensitive apomediative support tools ensure that the key requirements of self-produced health are met, along with legally informed and preference-based consent to any subsequent provider action. The desirable form of apomediative support is a publicly accessible, direct-to-citizen, provider-independent, multi-criteria analysis-based decision support of the sort available in many other areas of self-production. Which (UK), Tænk (Denmark), Choice (Australia) and numerous other comparison magazines and websites provide independent multi-criterial support for decisions on, for example, which food and transport to buy to self-produce nutrition and movement. A personalised decision support tool for the statin decision is provided as illustration: Should I go to my general practitioner and ask for a statin prescription or go to discuss taking statins, in the light of the preliminary opinion of the tool

Title: Supporting ALL victims of violence, abuse, neglect or exploitation: guidance for health providers.
Word count: 2498
Abstract: Smaller groups of victims of violence, abuse, neglect or exploitation - such as male victims of intimate partner violence (IPV), victims of elder abuse, victims of abuse by carers, victims of parent abuse, victims of human trafficking, girls and boys below 18 years engaging in sex work, victims of sexual exploitation by gangs or groups and victims of honour based violence (such as forced marriages and female genital mutilation) - are often in contact with the health care system without being identified as such and frequently do not receive appropriate treatment. To address this problem, two things need to happen: 1) that ALL groups of victims of violence, abuse, neglect or exploitation are explicitly listed in policies and protocols, and 2) that both the similarities as well as the differences between the groups with regard to identification, support and referral - described in this article - are explained, so that health providers are appropriately supported in this important function

Abstract: T. Fachrul Razie. Changes of Chemical Soil Properties and Growth as well as Yield of Soybean and Maize on Podzolic Soil by Application Soil Amendments and Cropping Patterns. Growth and crop yield depend on soil fertility. Aceh has agricultural land with relatively low fertility, some of which are podzolic soil. The properties of podzolic soil should be improved in order to be utilized for cultivated land and produce maximum crop production. The process of improving the properties of podzolic soil can be done by using soil amendments like cow dung and biochar, where the use of soil biochar and cow dung can significantly affect for growth and crop yield. In addition, cropping patterns can also affect the improvement of soil properties that impact on increased growth and yield of crops. Many benefits of the use of soil amendments that have been obtained through research, but information about the use of soil amendments in the form of cow dung and biochar that can increase the production of soybean and maize with various cropping patterns at once can improve the chemical properties of podzolic soil has not been known. The purpose of study was to analyzed the effect of soil amendments and cropping patterns and the interaction of these two factor on the chemical soil properties, growth, and yield of soybean and maize on podzolic soil. The research was conducted in Teurebeh Village, Kota Jantho, Aceh Besar District, Soil and Plant Laboratory, Faculty of Agriculture, Syiah Kuala University, and Plant Physiology Laboratory, Faculty of Agriculture, Syiah Kuala University, from June 2016 to January 2017. The research used a Randomized Block Design factorial 5 x 3 with 3 replication, whereas the soil amendments consisted of : NPK 400 kg ha-1, Biochar 10 ton ha-1, Cow dung 10 ton ha-1, Biochar 10 ton ha-1+NPK 400 kg ha -1, and Cow dung 10 ton ha-1+NPK 400 kg ha-1and cropping patterns consist of : monoculture of soybean, monoculture of maize, and intercropping soybean-maize. The soil chemistry parameters observed baseline soil analysis (routine analysis) and soil analysis after treatment consisting of soil pH, C-organic, N-total, P-available, and K-exch. The growth and yield parameters of soybean crops observed consisted of : change in plant height 3-4, 4-5, and 5-6 week after planting (WAP), and weight of soybean seed per plot and weight of 100 seeds of soybean. The growth and yield parameters of maize observed consisted : change in plant height aged 3-4, 4-5, 5-6 and 6-7 WAP as well as weight of cob without husk per plot and sugar content of maize. To measure the benefits of intercropping system from land use aspect, it is calculated land equivalent ratio (LER). The result of this study indicate that the soil amendments has not significant effect on soil pH, C-organic, and N-total and all growth observation parameters and crop yields as well as have a very significant effect on change of P-available and K-exch.While the cropping patterns had significant effect on soil pH, change in plant height of soybean 3-4 WAP, 5-6 WAP, and LER, and very significant effect on P-available, K-exch, change in plant height of soybean 4-5 WAP, weight of soybean seed per plot, change in plant height of maize 4-5 WAP, 5-6 WAP, 6-7 WAP, weight of cob without husk per plot and sugar content of maize, and not significant effect on C-organic, N-total, weight 100 seeds of soybeans, and changes in plant height of maize 3-4 WAP.There were interactions between soil amendments and cropping patterns on P-available, K-exch, changes in plant height of maize 6-7 WAP, weight of cob without husk per plot, and sugar content of maize.Keywords ; maize, soybean, soil amendments, cropping patterns, podzolic soilBanda Ace

The growth and yield parameters of maize observed consisted : change in plant height aged 3-4, 4-5, 5-6 and 6-7 WAP as well as weight of cob without husk per plot and sugar content of maize. The growth and yield parameters of soybean crops observed consisted of : change in plant height 3-4, 4-5, and 5-6 week after planting (WAP), and weight of soybean seed per plot and weight of 100 seeds of soybean. Many benefits of the use of soil amendments that have been obtained through research, but information about the use of soil amendments in the form of cow dung and biochar that can increase the production of soybean and maize with various cropping patterns at once can improve the chemical properties of podzolic soil has not been known. The purpose of study was to analyzed the effect of soil amendments and cropping patterns and the interaction of these two factor on the chemical soil properties, growth, and yield of soybean and maize on podzolic soil. Changes of Chemical Soil Properties and Growth as well as Yield of Soybean and Maize on Podzolic Soil by Application Soil Amendments and Cropping Patterns. The process of improving the properties of podzolic soil can be done by using soil amendments like cow dung and biochar, where the use of soil biochar and cow dung can significantly affect for growth and crop yield. Keywords ; maize, soybean, soil amendments, cropping patterns, podzolic soil In addition, cropping patterns can also affect the improvement of soil properties that impact on increased growth and yield of crops. The soil chemistry parameters observed baseline soil analysis (routine analysis) and soil analysis after treatment consisting of soil pH, C-organic, N-total, P-available, and K-exch. The properties of podzolic soil should be improved in order to be utilized for cultivated land and produce maximum crop production. The research was conducted in Teurebeh Village, Kota Jantho, Aceh Besar District, Soil and Plant Laboratory, Faculty of Agriculture, Syiah Kuala University, and Plant Physiology Laboratory, Faculty of Agriculture, Syiah Kuala University, from June 2016 to January 2017. Growth and crop yield depend on soil fertility. To measure the benefits of intercropping system from land use aspect, it is calculated land equivalent ratio (LER). Aceh has agricultural land with relatively low fertility, some of which are podzolic soil.

Title: Extracellular chloride is required for efficient activation of secondary signalling pathways during platelet aggregation
Word count: 2303
Abstract: Anion channels perform a diverse range of functions and have been implicated in ATP release, volume regulation and phosphatidylserine exposure. Platelets have been shown to express several anion channels however their function is incompletely understood. Due to a paucity of specific pharmacological blockers, we investigated the global  effect of extracellular chloride substitution on platelet activation using aggregometry and flow cytometry. In the absence of extracellular chloride we observed a modest effect on the maximum aggregation response to thrombin or collagen-related peptide. Although the rate of aggregation was substantially reduced in a manner that was dependent on the extracellular chloride concentration, aggregation in the absence of chloride was noticeably biphasic, indicative of impaired secondary signalling. This was further investigated by targeting secondary agonists with aspirin and apyrase or by blockade of the ADP receptor P2Y12. Under these conditions, the rates of aggregation were comparable to those recorded in the absence of extracellular chloride. Finally, we assessed platelet granule release by flow cytometry and report a chloride-dependent element of alpha, but not dense, granule secretion. Taken together these data support a role for anion channels in the efficient induction of platelet activation, likely via enhancement of secondary signalling pathways

These experiments highlight a role for anion channels in modulating the rate of platelet aggregation.

Taken together these data support a role for anion channels in the efficient induction of platelet activation, likely via enhancement of secondary signalling pathways. Finally, we assessed platelet granule release by flow cytometry and report a chloride-dependent element of alpha, but not dense, granule secretion. Maximum aggregation (aii) and the initial rate of aggregation (aiii) were calculated for each condition. Due to a paucity of specific pharmacological blockers, we investigated the effect of extracellular chloride substitution on platelet activation using aggregometry and flow cytometry. Granule release: Thrombin-evoked alpha and dense granule release was assessed by flow cytometry using fluorescently-conjugated CD62P and CD63 antibodies (BD biosciences, Oxford, UK), respectively. However, the platelet Cl - equilibrium is ≈35mV in the platelet , meaning activation of a Cl - conductance would depolarise rather than hyperpolarise platelets.

Title: Artificial intelligence in cardiology : applications, benefits and challenges
Word count: 2063
Abstract: Evidently, the potential benefits of AI in cardiology are enormous.  However, such benefits are not without challenges.  First, there are clear benefits for improving work productivity. There are currently fewer physicians to care for an ever - increasing aging population (WHO 2016). AI can support, rather than replace physicians, generating time - and cost - saving benefits for them and their patients and enabling more compassionate and thorough interactions. However, as more tasks become automated, there are possibilities that fewer physicians will be required to work or that fewer will do so on a full - time basis, since many tasks could be delivered through platforms by part-time, freelancer physicians. This may impact the relationship between patients, physicians and administrative staff in healthcare systems

basic summary: Machine learning can positively impact cardiovascular disease prediction and diagnosis by developing algorithms that can model representations of data, much faster and more efficiently than physicians can. Thus, results from unsupervised learning algorithms can feed into supervised learning algorithms for predictive modelling. To develop such intelligent systems machine learning algorithms are required to enable dynamic learning capabilities in relation to changing conditions. Such predictive models can be produced with “supervised learning” algorithms that require a dataset with predictor variables and labeled outcomes (Johnson et al 2018). 3 Increased data storage, high computing power and exponential learning capabilities together enable computers to learn much faster than humans and address the challenge of limitless choice. This may impact the relationship between patients, physicians and administrative staff in healthcare systems (see Taylor et al 2016). What matters the most is the clinical efficacy of algorithms and their use of data (Future Advocacy 2018).

Title: The effect of informal Central Bank communication : machine learning approach
Word count: 803
Abstract: The management of agents’ expectations is a key feature of monetary policy because the central bank only has direct control over very short-term interest rates. The main tool to influence people’s expectations is communication. A number of both qualitative formal (e.g. statements and minutes) and informal (speeches) channels as well as quantitative channels, such as economic projections, are currently used by policymakers. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the effects of central bank communication can contribute to effective monetary policy. For instance, it may help the European Central Bank to phase out the quantitative easing without causing severe instability. It is important to emphasise that this research is not about explicit forward guidance but instead focuses on the overall positive or negative sentiment (tone) about economic conditions in speeches. The paper investigates three hypotheses regarding the effect of positive or negative sentiment (tone) about economic conditions conveyed in Bank of England speeches on government bond yields in the United Kingdom: (H1) A positive sentiment (tone) about economic conditions conveyed in speeches should have a positive effect on bond yields. (H2) The impact of a speech should vary by the position of a speaker. Speeches by more senior people should have a larger effect. (H3) The stock of communication matters. If there was little communication prior to the speech, the impact of a speech should be larger
basic similarity: 0.6280797300963465
basic summary: Finally, the sentiment index is calculated by counting the number of positive and negative words in relevant parts of speeches. The estimates should be close to true values as there are not many factors that affect bond yields and are correlated with the sentiment index. A standard-deviation increase in the sentiment index leads to around a 1–1.7 basis point rise in the bond yields across the curve. Such use is not ideal as markets should react only to the surprise component of the sentiment (the difference between the absolute index and its expectations). The magnitude of the effect is similar to that for the surprise component of consumer price index (CPI) data releases. It would be interesting to estimate the effect for a longer horizon than one day to investigate whether the effect persists. statements and minutes) and informal (speeches) channels as well as quantitative channels, such as economic projections, are currently used by policymakers. Primary limitations of this research are related to measurement error in the sentiment index. In addition, an absolute index, which ignores market expectations, has been used due to the lack of data. if there was no communication in the week prior to the speech, the effect is two- to three- times larger. For example, ‘increasing risk’ and ‘increasing growth’ would both be classified as positive phrases even though the former is clearly negative. The methodology to estimate the sentiment index can be applied to other contexts.

Finally, the sentiment index is calculated by counting the number of positive and negative words in relevant parts of speeches. After calculating the sentiment index, daily changes in the yields of two-, five- and ten-year government bonds are regressed on lagged values of the dependent variable, the sentiment index and control variables (monetary surprises and surprise components of macroeconomic data releases) in order to account for factors that can affect bond yields during the day.

Word count: 2088
Abstract: A summary of a paper presented at the CARN 40th Anniversary Conference at Bishop Grosseteste University in Lincoln, UK, 10-13 November 2016, with the theme of 'Integrating the Personal and Political in Professional Practice'. The full paper outlines my living-educational-theory as an explanation of my educational influences in my learning, the learning of others and the learning of social formations, over the 49 years of my research programme, whilst working with political, historical and cultural influences in my practice and understandings.  It integrates insights from the work of De Sousa Santos (2014) on ‘Epistemologies of the South: Justice against Epistemicide’ as one of the most advanced social theories of today.

Title: Editorial: Practitioner Research in Higher Education, 11 (1)
Word count: 1570
Abstract: This special issue of Practitioner Research in Higher Education focuses specifically on assessment and feedback. We know that assessment has a powerful influence on student engagement and learning, making it an important focus for enhancement activity. We also know, however, that assessment is a nuanced, complex and contested area of university practice, which makes it a notoriously challenging one to change. Heightened awareness of the centrality of assessment-related matters, a commitment to scholarly endeavour and the processes of conducting, sharing and debating diverse approaches and perspectives are all vital. The two research papers and nine evaluation studies of innovative practice in this issue provide insight into the ways that many academics are, in various ways, investigating and enhancing their practice in this important area

Title: Digital skills, confidence and motivation: technology supported authentic learning in journalism education
Word count: 1149
Abstract: This study explores the use of technology to incorporate authentic learning practices into the Review and Lifestyle Journalism module at Staffordshire University. The research takes a constructivist view, considering both tutor observation and student feedback to evaluate an experiential journalism project, StaffsLive Reviews, developed in the academic year 2016-17. Here authentic learning is defined as designing activities to provide meaningful, ‘real-life’ situations which are relevant from a student’s perspective, while providing protective scaffolding to support learning (Icuc and Marin 2014 and Stein 2004). This encapsulates a broader institutional focus on employability, by designing activities that closely match ‘real-world’ tasks of media professionals (Lombardi 2007)
basic similarity: 0.42031128939819795
basic summary: Students choosing to stay involved in the project outside of any formal assessment indicates a deeper level learning that could positively influence a propensity for life-long learning (Foresight 2017). Authentic learning in this way enables students to use their skills and knowledge in the same way a professional would. This study explores the use of technology to incorporate authentic learning practices into the Review and Lifestyle Journalism module at Staffordshire University. In journalism, digital platforms have enabled students to publish and share work with a wider community outside of their university course.

James  Crabbe FRSA asks how far we have really moved since.In his influential book published in 1968  the British criminologist, Nigel Walker, set out what he believed should be the aims of a  penal system: to protect offenders and suspected offenders against unofficial retaliation; and  to reduce the frequency of the types of behaviour prohibited by criminal law. In seeking to  meet these aims, Walker adds that the penal system should seek to cause the minimum of  suffering (whether to offenders or to others) and be designed to ensure that it would not  increase the incidence of offences.

Title: Translating Gesture from Sculpture to Text
Word count: 3826
Abstract: This is a collaborative practice-based investigation which aims to outline some of the key lessons and implications from a number of the uses of gesture in the sculpture of Barbara Hepworth. This mini-research project consists of this formal academic paper and a selection of digital multimedia poetry which functions as a creative-critical intervention and a component part of this paper. The digital multimedia poetry was created in collaboration by the authors in response to Hepworth’s original sculpture at the Barbara Hepworth Museum (St Ives) and the Hepworth Wakefield (Yorkshire). The creative element of the investigation attempts to model Hepworth’s use of gesture and in doing so translate the function of gesture from its use in a visual arts practice to a multimedia textual practice. Building on a multi-disciplinary understanding of gesture and Hepworth’s own ideas about “gesture in landscape”, the project considers the gestures of the artist, gestures represented in the artwork, and gestures choreographed by the artwork (in the reader/audience/participant). The collaboration features new interactive works and is intended to function as a provocation raising questions about the interaction between tension and gesture in both sculptural and digital textual practices, rather than an authoritative, exhaustive or conclusive typology of the use of gesture in Hepworth’s corpus
basic similarity: 0.68636738431871
basic summary: Indeed the gesture of formation of an artwork creates a dynamic tension between the gesture of the artist and the virtual formation of that being represented. In those previously discussed works which enact gesture in landscape (drawing upon waves, natural rock forms, and sea caves) the repeated actions of nature are inscribed within the form. (Hepworth 5) 15A third use of gesture in Hepworth’s work is the gesture of invitation. It features eighteen digital poems created collaboratively which attempt to implement the three different uses of gesture in Hepworth’s work identified above. There is room for development in both the practice work and in sketching out a fuller typology of gesture as it functions in Hepworth’s work. Yet we have begun with an identification of gestures of tension, formation and invitation, and these functions have proved a useful starting point for new collaborative practice.

Hepworth  © Bowness    Figure 6: Barbara Heptworth, Pendour (1947). Hepworth  © Bowness   11When describing “gesture in landscape” in her autobiography, Hepworth nods to some of these forces in  her own work:  In all these shapes the translation of what one feels about man and nature much be conveyed by  the sculptor in terms of mass, inner tension and rhythm, scale in relation to our human size and  the quality of surface which speaks through our hands and eyes. Hepworth ©  Bowness   10Implosion too is an implied future action, another “about to happen” that can be read in some of  Hepworth’s pieces. Hepworth © Bowness    16Hepworth herself invites the audience to be embraced by the pierced form:  The forms which have had special meaning to me since childhood have been the standing form  (which is the translation of my feeling towards the human being standing in landscape); the two  forms (which is the tender relationship of one living thing beside another); and the closed form,  such as the oval, spherical or pierced form (sometimes incorporating colour) which translates  for me the association and meaning of gesture in landscape; in the repose of say a mother and  child, or the feeling of the embrace of living things, either in nature or the human spirit.

text_rank summary: Conclusion  22In the course of the research for this project, which saw us draw upon our existing personal relationships  with the relevant landscapes and each other’s practice (in addition to the usual book-based research and  museum visits), we have made inroads into both emergent digital poetry practice methods and our  understanding of the function of gesture in Hepworth’s sculpture.Interestingly the impact of translating this shaping function into  our practice, has led to a number of the virtual works taking on a distinctly sculptural quality.4  6The next portion of the paper outlines and defines three uses of gesture (as defined above) which we have  identified in Hepworth’s sculpture: gestures of tension, gestures of formation and gestures of invitation.This gesture towards past action is not unusual in  choreography and performing arts (consider for instance the clown drawing a tear on his face, expressing  that he has been made sad by the previous event), but it is especially pertinent to static art forms where  gesture is the gateway to the experience of formation.This specificity does not translate well to  all practices, notably in the use of gesture in music and the acoustic arts in which the shape that implies  action need not be tied to the human form.Hepworth © Bowness    16Hepworth herself invites the audience to be embraced by the pierced form:  The forms which have had special meaning to me since childhood have been the standing form  (which is the translation of my feeling towards the human being standing in landscape); the two  forms (which is the tender relationship of one living thing beside another); and the closed form,  such as the oval, spherical or pierced form (sometimes incorporating colour) which translates  for me the association and meaning of gesture in landscape; in the repose of say a mother and  child, or the feeling of the embrace of living things, either in nature or the human spirit.Figure 1: The researchers on St Mary’s, Isles of Scilly    Gesture  2This research project involves attempting to translate “gesture” as an art function across two very different  art practices, cultures and media-forms.

(53) Gesture as Translated to Practice 17The selection of practice presented alongside this paper is designed specifically for this mini-research project and is intended as a piece of practice-as-research which primarily speaks for itself. This project considers the gestures of the artist, gestures represented in the artwork, and gestures choreographed by the artwork (in the reader/audience/participant). Building on a multi-disciplinary understanding of gesture and Hepworth’s own ideas about “gesture in landscape”, the project considers the gestures of the artist, gestures represented in the artwork, and gestures choreographed by the artwork (in the reader/audience/participant). In physics, tension is a force and a type of potential energy stored within matter: here too a future action or movement is implied. 13Aside from the literal sculpting work and craftsmanship involved, some works imply alternative conceptual formations.

frequency summary: Gestures of Tension  7If gesture is a shape which implies action, gestures of tension are those shapes whose implied action takes  place in the future; gestures of tension suggest that something is “about to happen” and express imminence,  and this is analogous to the way the term “tension” is used in narrative studies (e.g. The first four poems are image-based and use projective  verse, open form and visual techniques to create gestural textual environments; this is particularly apparent  in the precarious forms in “Zennor Carn” and “Lanson” and the unstable three-line stanza in “Lankidden”. These poems attempt to bring together some of the ideas and functions  from the “Kinetic” and “Static” works, and most attempt to implement one or more of the gesture functions  identified in Hepworth’s work. Le texte est destiné  à provoquer, par l’emploi d’oeuvres interactives, la réflexion sur les liens entre tension et geste en sculpture et dans les  textes numériques, plutôt qu’à cataloguer les gestes chez Hepworth dans le but d’en faire une typologie exhaustive. This mini-research  project consists of this formal academic paper and a selection of digital multimedia poetry which functions  as a creative-critical intervention and a component part of this paper.1 The digital multimedia poetry was  created in collaboration by the authors in response to Hepworth’s original sculpture at the Barbara  Hepworth Museum (St Ives) and the Hepworth Wakefield (Yorkshire). Put simply digital poetry is poetic practice which necessarily  involves the use of computational devices or digital media, and it is a subset of electronic literature, which  refers to “works with important literary aspects that take advantage of the capabilities and contexts  provided by the stand-alone or networked computer” (ELO).5 This medium for poetry affords great  potential for creating virtual poetry environments which a reader can navigate and interact with and there  is a rich tradition of works which take advantage of that potential (consider for instance “Poemas no meio  do caminho” by Rui Torres).

Title: The impact of communities of practice on masters dissertations: a small scale case Study of MSc project management students
Word count: 3177
Abstract: Communities of Practice (CoPs) are known to increase knowledge sharing and personal development. In this pilot study in a UK higher education institution, we explored using CoPs with Postgraduate (Masters and PhD) students with a view to investigating the CoPs’ impact on the Masters students’ dissertation engagement and achievement.  We conducted action research, forming 4 CoPs, each including 1 PhD student and approximately 3 MSc students. We analysed the 11 MSc Project Management students’ engagement, results and feedback and the 4 Project Management PhD researchers’ feedback using mixed methods from questionnaires, feedback forums and quantitative analysis of dissertation results (marks). We found four categories of outcome: (i) MSc students’ mode of communication with their CoP; (ii) MSc students’ contribution to their CoP; (iii) benefits to MSc students; and (iv) impact on MSc dissertation results. Our outcomes show that the CoP had an impact on MSc student engagement and performance, and indicate CoPs as worthy of further investigation for enhancing students’ learning experience

Title: Infrared spectroscopy of the merger candidate KIC 9832227
Word count: 2997
Abstract: Context. It has been predicted that the object KIC 9832227 – a contact binary star – will undergo a merger in 2022.2±0.7.We describe the near infrared spectrum of this object as an impetus to obtain pre-merger data. Aims. We aim to characterise (i) the nature of the individual components of the binary and (ii) the likely circumbinary environment, so that the merger – if and when it occurs – can be interpreted in an informed manner. Methods. We use infrared spectroscopy in the wavelength range 0.7 μm–2.5 μm, to which we fit model atmospheres to represent the individual stars. We use the binary ephemeris to determine the orbital phase at the time of observation. Results. We find that the infrared spectrum is best fitted by a single component having effective temperature 5 920 K, log [g] = 4.1 and solar metallicity, consistent with the fact that the system was observed at conjunction. Conclusions. The strength of the infrared H lines is consistent with a high value of log g, and the strength of the Ca ii triplet indicates the presence of a chromosphere, as might be expected from rapid stellar rotation. The He i absorption we observe likely arises in He excited by coronal activity in a circumstellar envelope, suggesting that the weakness of the Ca ii triplet is also likely chromospheric in origin

basic summary: V. Pavlenko et al. The UTC time of mid-observation of our spectrum (2457942.04199) was converted into the BJD(TDB) timescale using the IDL routines from Eastman et al. In the case of the Sun the line is also observed in absorp- tion; Avrett et al. Significant molec- ular features are not seen in the observed spectrum, therefore we accounted for only atomic lines from the VALD3 database (Ryabchikova et al., 2015). Middle panel: best the fit to the observed Ca ii triplet, with classical and “chromospheric” model atmo- spheres. Indeed, our fits of the theoretical spec- tra computed for log g = 4.19 and log g = 4.10 to the observed spectra are far superior. Left: dereddened IRTF spectrum of KIC 9832227, together with the fit with b = 1; the case b = 0 is also shown for comparison. Right: fit to the spectrum containing Si I lines, marked by vertical arrows; the He i line is also shown. However, we see that practically all notable lines in the near IR spectrum are well fitted with close-to-solar abundances; the likely errors do not exceed 0.3 dex. The discrepancies between computed and observed Ca ii lines strength may be explained by several factors, such as NLTE effects or a Ca deficit. 3 we show the hydrogen lines computed for the case of lower log g = 2.0. We draw particular attention to the modelling of the moder- ately strong hydrogen lines, to which our model provides a satis- factory fit.

We also note here an alternative interpretion: our classical model atmospheres were computed for Rosseland mean optical depth in the range τRoss = 10−5 – 100 but such models lead to Ca ii lines that are too strong. ⋆ E-mail:yp@mao.kiev.ua KIC 9832227 was identified by Molnar et al.

Title: MetQy – an R package to query metabolic functions of genes and genomes
Word count: 2469
Abstract: Summary: With the rapid accumulation of sequencing data from genomic and metagenomic studies, there is an acute need for better tools that facilitate their analyses against biological functions. To this end, we developed MetQy, an open–source R package designed for query–based analysis of functional units in [meta]genomes and/or sets of genes using the The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Furthermore, MetQy contains visualisation and analysis tools and facilitates KEGG’s flat file manipulation. Thus, MetQy enables better understanding of metabolic capabilities of known genomes or user–specified [meta]genomes by using the available information and can help guide studies in microbial ecology, metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.  Availability and Implementation: The MetQy R package is freely available and can be downloaded from our group’s website (http://osslab.lifesci.warwick.ac.uk) or GitHub (https://github.com/OSS-Lab/MetQy)

sim_matrix summary: This example demonstrates how MetQy can be used to retrieve KEGG genome data and how the metabolic functions of the extracted/matched organisms can be queried/identified in terms of KEGG modules. Users with a paid KEGG subscription can use MetQy parsing functions to update the data that the package uses. The MetQy parsing functions allow the production of the updated data, by formatting the relevant KEGG data files into R structures. They can also be used as stand–alone functions to introduce KEGG data into the R environment. Users without FTP access can analyse the KEGG genome, module and ortholog databases indirectly by using this family of functions on built–in formatted KEGG data which is not directly accessible by the user.

Title: Computer modelling of hafnium doping in lithium niobate
Word count: 2118
Abstract: Lithium niobate, LiNbO3, is an important technological material with good electro-optic, acousto-optic, elasto-optic, piezoelectric and nonlinear properties. Doping LiNbO3 with hafnium, Hf has been shown to improve the resistance of the material to optical damage. Computer modelling provides a useful means of determining the properties of doped and undoped LiNbO3, including its defect chemistry, and the effect of doping on the structure. In this paper, Hf doped LiNbO3 has been modelled, and the final defect configurations are found to be consistent with experimental results
basic similarity: 0.5955483002806872
basic summary: Interatomic Potentials In this paper use has been made of a previously derived potential for LiNbO3 , and a potential fitted to the structure of HfO2. Much useful information about lithium niobate and its defect properties can be obtained by computer modelling, based on the description of interactions between ions by effective potentials. Computer modelling provides a useful means of determining the properties of doped and undoped LiNbO3, including its defect chemistry, and the effect of doping on the structure. Future calculations will be carried out which will model the effect of Hf concentration on the preferred dopant sites, enabling comparison with these results to be made.

Title: Management services and supporting the board
Word count: 2583
Abstract: There are steps that directors and boards can take to ensure that those who support them are themselves supported and enabled to obtain access to the information and papers they need to fulfil their responsibilities, avoid conflicts of interest and provide independent and objective advice. This article considers factors that senior executives and audit, legal, governance, risk, compliance and other management services professionals should consider when making the transition on a whole or part-time basis from supporting management and improving performance to supporting the board and providing assurance.

basic summary: Ensuring Relevance Individual compliance, environmental, governance, finance, legal, risk, internal audit and other professionals with a corporate wide remit and assurance role will often focus upon particular areas. The heads of certain support functions should have a direct right of access to the independent or non-executive members of a committee or board without management colleagues being present. Escalation routes to a committee or board chairman may be required, as concerns could relate to top management or a chief executive officer. This could be achieved by mapping processes, identifying factors that either deliver or could frustrate the delivery of key board and corporate objectives, and ensuring they are covered. Those who are engaged in assurance activities on behalf of a board and advising and supporting it are often professionals with their own codes of practice and standards.

Title: Characterisation of the Clothespin relocation task as a functional assessment tool
Word count: 4056
Abstract: Method:	 The Clothespin Relocation Task has been adapted from an arm training tool to create an instrument to measure hand function.  It is based in the time to move three clothespins from a horizontal to a vertical bar, and back.    To be generally useful, the measures need to have their psychometric properties investigated.  This paper measures the characteristics of an able bodied population to gain an understanding of the underlying statistical properties of the test, in order that it can then be used to compare with different subject groups.  Fifty adults (29 males, 21 females, mean age 31) were tested with five runs of three clothespins  moved up and then down.  Ten subjects returned twice more to observe repeatability.    Results: There was a non-Gaussian range of times, from 2.5s to 7.37s.  Mean time for Up was 4.1s, and was 4.0s for Down, with a skew towards the faster times of 0.57 for Up and 0.97 for Down.  Over the three sessions there was a small (not significant) increase in speed 4.1+/-0.5s first run Down to 3.5 +/-0.4s for third.  Conclusion: These initial tests confirm that it has potential to be used as a measurement of the performance of arm movement

Clothespin Relocation Test The Clothespin Relocation Test (CRT) is an established tool for training upper limb dexterity. Similarly to the times to move the pins Up there is an upper limit for the times and longer distribution of the slower times. When a modified version of the CRT, (with a standardised pin order for motion analysis), was used with four prosthesis users the times were longer than the unaffected users.

Its distribution is non Gaussian with a skew towards the lower times for able bodied subject using their dominant hand. The results suggests that it can be used as a test, repeated over time to monitor changes in performance or for comparisons of prosthesis design including control strategies. Measurement is the time to move 3 red clothespins from 3 positions (top, middle, bottom) on the vertical bar to anywhere on the middle horizontal bar.

basic summary: All staff need to understand how Lean and quality improvement fit the organizational strategy, and understand their specific role in continuous improvement. Berwick stresses the need for hospital managers to trust hospital staff to ‘become citizens in the improvement of their own work’ (Berwick, 2003, p. 449). This is consistent with earlier research suggesting that health professionals sustain practices that make sense to them, make their work easier and/or improve patient care (Timmons et al., 2014).

Title: A visual exploration of melodic relationships within traditional music collections
Word count: 3791
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to discuss a technique for visually exploring melodic relationships within traditional tune collections encoded in abc notation, a widely used text-based music representation system particularly popular for folk and traditional music. There are approximately ½ million melodies encoded in abc on the web and abcnotation.com provides a searchable index of the entire corpus with tools to view, download and listen to the scores.   This paper stems from related work known as TuneGraph which uses a melodic similarity measure to derive a proximity graph representing relationships between tunes in the abc corpus, and which allows users of abcnotation.com to explore melodic similarity. As it stands TuneGraph only gives a localised view of the melodic relationships: this paper aims to look at exploring those relationships at a global (corpus-based) level via a prototype visualisation tool. Currently the tool is not interactive: in this paper the aim is to consider a proof-of-concept approach to explore where there is a useful visualisation possible; future work will look at user interactivity with the tool

basic summary: The corpus graph G(V, E) is constructed as discussed, with edges in E only included between pairs of vertices if the corresponding tunes are sufficiently similar. This restricted graph is referred to henceforth as the corpus graph, (also referred to as the fundamental proximity graph in ). In this graph each vertex represents a tune and edge weights represent similarities between tunes: the greater the similarity the larger the edge weight. In the sparse proximity graph is sparsified further and processed to produce a collection of local tune graphs, one for each connected vertex in the graph. TuneGraph uses a similarity measure to derive a proximity graph representing similarities within the abc notation corpus (~½ million tunes) which backs the search engine.

Obviously a disconnected  component may have many vertices which are not quite similar  enough to be connected to other components in the original  proximity graph and probably only one of these will end up  being connected. Unfortunately, in the context of a proximity graph, such a  scheme potentially discards a lot of valuable information:  although two vertices may not be connected because the  corresponding tunes are not sufficiently similar, nonetheless it is  possible to measure the similarity between them and use that to  inform the visualisation.

Title: Sustainable supply and demand chain integration within global manufacturing industries
Word count: 3397
Abstract: Given the emerging industrial management strategies considering three pillars of sustainability in particular, there is a vital need to determine the differences of sustainability practices within both supply and demand distribution systems through global manufacturing environments providing with the successful global trade and logistics. This research paper aims to explore the interactions and advantages of sustainability applications within both supply and demand chain management. The research framework adopted consists of survey questionnaire method which is conducted within a global tyre manufacturing company. The research results and analysis justify the need for the application of ethical codes, supply chain transformation and the effective association of industry executives, professional bodies and the government. The research study also identifies that the vital incentive factors for the organisation towards sustainable supply demand chain (SSDC) are mostly the financial benefits of doing so and therefore, a positive mind-set shift towards greening practices is required

Title: A novel method to determine dynamic temperature trends applied to in-shoe temperature data during walking
Word count: 2663
Abstract: Body temperature is one of the fundamental measures considered in the assessment of health and wellbeing, with various medical conditions known to give rise to abnormal changes in temperature.   In particular, abnormal variations in dynamic temperature patterns during walking or exercise may be linked to a range of foot problems, which are of particular concern in diabetic patients.  A number of studies have investigated normative temperature patterns of a population by considering data from multiple participants and averaging results after an acclimatisation interval. In this work we demonstrate that the temperature patterns obtained using such an approach may not be truly representative of temperature changes in a population, and the averaging process adopted may yield skewed results.  In this work we propose an alternative approach to determine generic reference temperature patterns based on a minimization of root mean square differences between time-shifted versions of temperature data collected from multiple participants. The results obtained indicate that this approach can yield a general trend that is more representative of actual temperature changes across a population than conventional averaging methods. The method we propose is also shown to better capture and link the effects of underlying factors that influence dynamic temperature trends, which could in turn lead to a better understanding of underlying physiological phenomena

basic summary: 2 shows the original temperature data for male and female participants together with the overall average and standard deviation using the standard averaging approach typically adopted in the literature. The RMSD approach proposed above was tested on in- shoe temperature measurements and the results obtained were compared to those from conventional temperature trends obtained by simple averaging procedures. Using the proposed method, all of the data captured is plotted with time, thus all of the different aspects of the data can be characterised using one model. CONCLUSION Temperature changes for medical investigations are typically conducted by computing the mean of the number of data sessions captured over the particular time period. considered the mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values in their investigation of the effect of ambient temperature and age on foot temperature. The acquired temperature data is averaged and the mean value with time, together with maximum and minimum or standard deviation are determined. The mean and standard deviation of the acquired data across participants are then used to characterize normal temperature values.

In this work we show that the aforementioned direct averaging or baseline temperature subtraction procedures that are often adopted in the literature can lead to a significant loss of information as well as a potential distortion of the actual temperature trends in a population of interest. Owen Falzon is with the Centre for Biomedical Cybernetics, University of Malta, Msida. In this work we propose an alternative approach to determine generic reference temperature patterns based on a minimization of root mean square differences between time- shifted versions of temperature data collected from multiple participants. However, it is clear that initial temperature conditions vary widely across participants, even after the acclimatisation interval, leading to an average trend with high standard deviations at each time point. We demonstrate that the absolute temperature values carry significant information and that a better outcome of temperature trends within a population can be obtained by time shifting and combining data from multiple participants and multiple sessions based on their root mean square differences.

frequency summary: Using the proposed method,  all of the data captured from the different subjects or sources  can be considered from one plot as well as its different trends  which could be due to the different source from where the  data is being captured. This proposed approach of applying the RMSD to a set of  captured data and then plotting the matched trends could be  applied to any data captured from different subjects or  scenarios over a period of time. Therefore, in plotting data with time using the method  proposed in this paper, one would be obtaining a more  informative pattern than when plotting data using the  conventional mean approach. Using the proposed method, all of the  data captured is plotted with time, thus all of the different  aspects of the data can be characterised using one model. An  array of RMSD values,  𝑅(𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑡0), is thus obtained where:  𝑅(𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑡0) = √ ∑ (𝑦𝑖(𝑡) − 𝑦𝑗(𝑡 − 𝑡0))2 𝑡2 𝑡=𝑡1 𝑁           (1)  for 𝑖=1, …, 𝐾 and 𝑗=1, …, 𝐾 (𝑖 ≠ 𝑗), where 𝐾 represents the  total number of acquired signals (across sessions and  participants).

Word count: 1087
Abstract: This dataset contains the annual aggregated income taxes of all the Italian municipalities over the years 2007–2011. Data are clustered over the Italian regions and provinces. The source of the data is the Italian Ministry of Economics and Finance. The administrative variations in Italy over the quinquennium have been taken into account. Data are useful to understand the economic structure of Italy at the microscopic level of municipalities. They can serve also for making comparisons between economical aspects and other features of the Italian cities.Peer-reviewedPublisher Versio

Title: Non-human gaming
Word count: 543
Abstract: In this talk, I will critically analyse the rise of video games that require limited human intervention to be played. Idle games such as Cookie Clicker and Adventure Capitalist, games made by algorithms such as No Man’s Sky, the programming of AI to play games such as Screeps, Drivatars and ghost cars in racing games, all suggest that human beings are becoming peripheral in the act of playing and in the definition of video games. Drawing on Sonia Fizek’s analysis of Slavoj Zizek and Robert Pfaller’s concept of interpassivity, and on studies on gamification and self-tracking, I will argue that Non-Human Gaming is not necessarily an exception to oppose to ‘standard’ video games, or a temporary trend. I will argue that the non-human has always been haunting the medium, and that studies on interactivity, agency, and player’s competences have been providing, so far, a comforting perspective that places the human at the centre. In fact, Non-Human Gaming is an adequate response to the disappearance of life from Earth – as it has been imagined, feared, and prophesised by scientists in the last few decades. Alexander Galloway’s concept of video games as allegories of life will be deployed to argue that digital games are transforming into living things, which could entirely replace human players and play by themselves. From this perspective, video games might be seen in relation to the rise of self-driving cars, algorithmic trade exchange, and remote warfare, which could be functioning by themselves after human extinction. Roger Caillois, in his early work on mimicry and mythology, was already prefiguring a similar hypothesis: living beings develop forms of dispersal and waste of energy (of which games are an example) that cannot be explained through a rationalistic view on evolution and species preservation, but are nonetheless defining characteristics of life

Title: Reasoning and learning services for coalition situational understanding
Word count: 3947
Abstract: Situational understanding requires an ability to assess the current situation and anticipate future situations, requiring both pattern recognition and inference. A coalition involves multiple agencies sharing information and analytics. This paper considers how to harness distributed information sources, including multimodal sensors, together with machine learning and reasoning services, to perform situational understanding in a coalition context. To exemplify the approach we focus on a technology integration experiment in which multimodal data — including video and still imagery, geospatial and weather data — is processed and fused in a service-oriented architecture by heterogeneous pattern recognition and inference components. We show how the architecture: (i) provides awareness of the current situation and prediction of future states, (ii) is robust to individual service failure, (iii) supports the generation of ‘why’ explanations for human analysts (including from components based on ‘black box’ deep neural networks which pose particular challenges to explanation generation), and (iv) allows for the imposition of information sharing constraints in a coalition context where there is varying levels of trust between partner agencies

basic summary: Once these services are made available to the system, the system itself can autonomously make a decision as to which model is most appropriate. This paper considers how to harness distributed information sources, including multimodal sensors, together with machine learning and reasoning services, to perform situational understanding in a coalition context. 4.2 Congestion Reasoner As shown in Figure 3, the congestion reasoner involves an integration of multiple services and data sources. In our instantiated system, this occurs between the congestion classifier model and the congestion reasoner service.

Sections 4 and 5 give a summary of two pieces of previous work in the domain of traffic congestion detection that, taken together, offer a coalition system for the detection of current traffic congestion (insight) and models for the prediction of future congestion (foresight) respectively. Furthermore, as we ensured that the system architecture we developed remained decoupled from the specific problem, our final system can be used as a template for approaching other CSU problems by simply exchanging the data sources and services related to the congestion space to ones relevant to alternative CSU problems. In our system, the object detector used in this interpretability technique already existed within our coalition of services as it was created as part of the congestion reasoner service chain.

Title: Metal-free selective mono-halodecarboxylation of heteroarenes under mild conditions
Word count: 2157
Abstract: The halodecarboxylation of heteroarene carboxylic acids by treatment with N-bromosuccinimide or N-chlorosuccinimide was performed. This procedure provides a convenient route to synthetically useful mono-halogenated heteroarene intermediates such as halo-indoles, -aza-indoles, -indazoles and -aza-indazoles. The mild conditions employed and simple protocol provides an advantage over traditional halodecarboxylation procedures that require expensive and toxic metal catalysts, basic conditions, time-consuming intermediate isolation and elevated reaction temperatures

Title: Circular Convolution Filter Bank Multicarrier (FBMC) System with Index Modulation
Word count: 3414
Abstract: Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with index modulation (OFDM-IM), which uses the subcarrier indices as a source of information, has attracted considerable interest recently. Motivated by the index modulation (IM) concept, we build a circular convolution filter bank multicarrier with index modulation (C-FBMC-IM) system in this paper. The advantages of the C-FBMC-IM system are investigated by comparing the interference power with the conventional C-FBMC system. As some subcarriers carry nothing but zeros, the minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalization bias power will be smaller comparing to the conventional C-FBMC system. As a result, our C-FBMC-IM system outperforms the conventional C-FBMC system. The simulation results demonstrate that both BER and spectral efficiency improvement can be achieved when we apply IM into the C-FBMC system

basic summary: For active subcarriers, we assume that s¯m,n and s˜m,n are independent and identically distributed with E{s¯m,n} = E{s˜m,n} = 0 and E{|s¯m,n|2} = E{|s˜m,n|2} = σ2s/2. (26) Since E[nnH ] = σ2nI, we have E‖Iη,n‖2 = σ 2 n 2 <{[B¯nB¯Hn − jB¯nB˜Hn + jB˜nB¯ H n + B˜nB˜ H n ]}. V¯n,i have the following properties V¯n,i = { I + j={V¯n,n} (i = n) j={V¯n,i} (i 6= n) . Com- pared with the conventional C-FBMC system where k = L, the MMSE equalization bias power of the C-FBMC-IM system is smaller since k < L in equation (25). The BER performance comparison of the C-FBMC-IM system and the C-FBMC system, with ρ = 1 than that of the C-FBMC system, with ρ = 1.0625. As we can see, the C-FBMC-IM is a block- based processing system, each C-FBMC-IM block contains N symbols with M subcarriers in each symbol.

Title: Estimating distemper virus dynamics among wolves and grizzly bears using serology and Bayesian state‐space models
Word count: 5838
Abstract: Many parasites infect multiple hosts, but estimating the transmission across host species remains a key challenge in disease ecology. We investigated the within and across host species dynamics of canine distemper virus (CDV) in grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) and wolves (Canis lupus) of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE). We hypothesized that grizzly bears may be more likely to be exposed to CDV during outbreaks in the wolf population because grizzly bears often displace wolves while scavenging carcasses. We used serological data collected from 1984 to 2014 in conjunction with Bayesian state‐space models to infer the temporal dynamics of CDV. These models accounted for the unknown timing of pathogen exposure, and we assessed how different testing thresholds and the potential for testing errors affected our conclusions. We identified three main CDV outbreaks (1999, 2005, and 2008) in wolves, which were more obvious when we used higher diagnostic thresholds to qualify as seropositive. There was some evidence for increased exposure rates in grizzly bears in 2005, but the magnitude of the wolf effect on bear exposures was poorly estimated and depended upon our prior distributions. Grizzly bears were exposed to CDV prior to wolf reintroduction and during time periods outside of known wolf outbreaks, thus wolves are only one of several potential routes for grizzly bear exposures. Our modeling approach accounts for several of the shortcomings of serological data and is applicable to many wildlife disease systems, but is most informative when testing intervals are short. CDV circulates in a wide range of carnivore species, but it remains unclear whether the disease persists locally within the GYE carnivore community or is periodically reintroduced from distant regions with larger host populations

This  is closely  related  to a complementary  log–log model used  for  interval- censored survival analyses (Heisey et al., 2010; Prentice &  Gloeckler, 1978).All models  investigated  converged  well, and based on DIC, models that included an effect of wolf expo- sure on bear exposure hazards generally performed better  (i.e., had  lower DIC) than models that assumed independent exposure hazards  between the two host species, or that there was an effect of bear ex- posure on wolf exposure (Table 1).For  example,  there  are  likely  differ- ences among laboratories; the timing of the infection is known only  to an interval (e.g., from birth to the date of the first sample); and op- timal threshold values for distinguishing between positive and nega- tives tests may be unknown (Gilbert et al., 2013).In our analyses,  the magnitude of the wolf effect on bears depended on our prior  distributions, suggesting the data were not particularly informa- tive about cross- species transmission due to more severe interval  censoring in the bear disease data (Supporting Information Figure  S1) and the limited number of outbreaks in wolves.There was no direct information on sensitivity or specificity in  this analysis, but the model deviance may decline  if an  individual’s  test status can be “re- assigned” as a potential testing error and al- lowing the transmission parameter either within or across species to  remain high (or low).Despite relatively long time series and a state- space hierarchi- cal model,  it  remained difficult  to assess correlations  in  the dis- ease dynamics among host species, which is an initial step in the  direction of estimating the amount of cross- species transmission.The es- timated slope of the relationship between wolf and bear infections,  α1, increased as we included more uncertainty into the model, either  by including potential testing errors or by using more diffuse prior  distributions (Figure 5).For pathogens with fast growth rates like CDV, an alternative ap- proach to assessing the directionality of transmission may be to  assess whether  the  infections  in one  species occur  prior  to  the  second host species using shorter windows of time (e.g., weekly  or  monthly).

Title: Optical Asymmetric Modulation for VLC Systems
Word count: 3614
Abstract: The explosive growth of connected devices and the increasing number of broadband users have led to an unprecedented growth in traffic demand. To this effect, the next generation wireless systems are envisioned to meet this growth and offer a potential data rate of 10 Gbps or more. In this context, an attractive solution to the current spectrum crunch issue is to exploit the visible light spectrum for the realization of high-speed commutation systems. However, this requires solutions to certain challenges relating to visible light communications (VLC), such as the stringent requirements of VLC-based intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD), which require signals to be real and unipolar. The present work proposes a novel power-domain multiplexing based optical asymmetric modulation (OAM) scheme for indoor VLC systems, which is particularly adapted to transmit high-order modulation signals using linear real and unipolar constellations that fit into the restrictions of IM/DD systems. It is shown that the proposed scheme provides improved system performance that outperforms alternative modulation schemes, at no extra complexity

basic summary: CONCLUSION We proposed a novel optical asymmetric modulation (OAM) scheme to facilitate the efficient transmission of high order modulation signals over VLC channels. The main characteristic of the proposed scheme is its low hardware complexity, where a high-order modulation is realized using a single transmitting LED and a single receiving PD. It is shown that the proposed scheme provides improved system performance that outperforms alternative modulation schemes at no extra complexity. SYSTEM AND CHANNEL MODEL A generic indoor VLC system is considered where the proposed OAM is realized by means of a single transmitting LED and a single receiving PD. The present contribution proposes a novel optical asymmet- ric modulation (OAM) scheme that is capable of enabling high-rate transmission in indoor VLC systems. VLC is a small-cell technology that exploits the unregu- lated visible light spectrum for short-range data transmission using intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD).

Title: Geostatistical models using remotely-sensed data predict savanna tsetse decline across the interface between protected and unprotected areas in Serengeti, Tanzania
Word count: 6251
Abstract: 1.Monitoring abundance is essential for vector management, but it is often only possible in a fraction of managed areas. For vector control programs, sampling to estimate abundance is usually carried out at a local-scale (10s km2), while interventions often extend across 100s km2. Geostatistical models have been used to interpolate between points where data are available, but this still requires costly sampling across the entire area of interest. Instead, we used geostatistical models to predict local-scale spatial variation in the abundance of tsetse – vectors of human and animal African trypanosomes - beyond the spatial extent of data to which models were fitted, in Serengeti, Tanzania.  2.We sampled Glossina swynnertoni and G. pallidipes &gt;10 km inside the Serengeti National Park (SNP) and along four transects extending into areas where humans and livestock live. We fitted geostatistical models to data &gt;10 km inside the SNP to produce maps of abundance for the entire region, including unprotected areas.  3.Inside the SNP, the mean number of G. pallidipes caught per trap per day in dense woodland was 166 (± 24 SE), compared to 3 (± 1) in grassland. G. swynnertoni was more homogenous with respective means of 15 (± 3) and 15 (± 8). In general, models predicted a decline in abundance from protected to unprotected areas, related to anthropogenic changes to vegetation, which was confirmed during field survey.  4.Synthesis and applications. Our approach allows vector control managers to identify sites predicted to have relatively high tsetse abundance, and therefore to design and implement improved surveillance strategies. In East and Southern Africa, trypanosomiasis is associated with wilderness areas. Our study identified pockets of vegetation which could sustain tsetse populations in farming areas outside the Serengeti National Park. Our method will assist countries in identifying, monitoring and, if necessary, controlling tsetse in trypanosomiasis foci. This has specific application to tsetse, but the approach could also be developed for vectors of other pathogens

Inside the protected area, the predicted abundance was >100, but within 5 km into unprotected areas, the predicted abundance was <10. Data from: Geostatistical models using remotely- sensed data predict savanna tsetse decline across the interface between pro- tected and unprotected areas in Serengeti, Tanzania. Although the abundance of G. swynnertoni was more homogenous between vegetation types than G. pallidipes, models still predicted a decline in numbers from protected to unprotected areas. In general, the models fitted to data >10 km inside the SNP, predicted a decline in tsetse abundance across the interface. Our mod- els explained, in part, this observed decline in tsetse abundance, but predicted tsetse to be present in numbers >100 in some unprotected areas. We fitted geostatistical models to data >10 km inside the SNP to produce maps of abundance for the entire region, including unprotected areas. It may be anticipated that regions adjacent to protected areas are subject to relatively high numbers of tsetse dispersing from inside pro- tected areas. (a) Glossina pallidipes observed; (b) Glossina swynnertoni observed; (c) G. pallidipes predicted; (d) G. swynnertoni predicted; (e) G. pallidipes residuals; and (f) G. swynnertoni residuals. Models should then be tested by selecting areas predicted to support relatively high vs. low abundance and these sites subject to tsetse surveillance. In general, models predicted a decline in abundance from protected to unprotected areas, re- lated to anthropogenic changes to vegetation, which was confirmed during field survey. We quantified mean daily numbers of tsetse caught in traps as a function of vegetation type, for areas >10 km inside the Serengeti National Park (SNP), Tanzania. Our study identified pockets of vegetation which could sustain tsetse populations in farming areas outside the 1998 | Journal of Applied Ecology LORD et aL. However, our models highlight there may be regions outside protected areas where vegetation is still sufficient to support tsetse populations. Application of these vector control methods over large and remote protected areas is not feasible, but control can be targeted in interface areas to reduce human and livestock exposure.

Extensive grid- based sampling of  tsetse using  traps  to estimate  abundance coupled with vegetation mapping using remotely- sensed  data  has  previously  been  applied  to  inform  tsetse  control  (Albert  et al.,  2015;  Dicko  et al.,  2014;  Hendrickx  et al.,  1999). More  recently,  human  infective T. brucei  rhodesiense  has  been  identified  by PCR  in  cattle  and wildlife  in  the  study  area  (Auty,  2009;  Kaare  et al.,  2007). However,  few  studies  have  linked  tsetse  abundance,  habitat  and  remotely- sensed  variables on  a  local  scale  (Kitron et al.,  1996).

A  better  under- standing  of  trypanosome  transmission  dynamics  and  approaches  to  improve  control  are  current  priorities  for  these  regions  (Auty  et al.,  2016; Diall et al., 2017). Allowing  for  savanna  tsetse  daily  dispersal  rates  (Hargrove,  1981),  a  buffer  of  500 m  around  each  trap was  used  to  calculate  the average LST, Landsat Band 7, NDVI and elevation. To determine  the significance of  the difference  in  log- transformed  abundance  observed  between  vegetation  types  for  each  species,  we  used  ANOVA  followed  by  the  Tukey  Honest  Significant Difference  test  (Tukey HSD). To compensate for this,  daily  catches  (y)  from  3 days  for  each  trap  were  transformed  to  log10(y + 1)  before  calculation  of mean  numbers  per  trap  per  day  and SE. For  G. pallidipes,  the  model,  using  remotely- sensed  data,  with  the  lowest  log- CPO  score  included  all  the  environmental  variables  (Table 1). org/10.1371/journal.pone.0011809 Mweempwa,  C., Marcotty,  T.,  De  Pus,  C.,  Penzhorn,  B.

Title: Antimicrobial activity of per acetic acid for trans-operative disinfection of endodontic files
Word count: 3399
Abstract: Reducing the accumulation of microorganisms on an endodontic file during endodontic treatment is important to limit recontamination of the root canal and increase likelihood of successful treatment outcome. Objective: To compare the antimicrobial activity of peracetic acid (PA), isopropyl alcohol and acetone against a range of bacteria and also for disinfection of contaminated endodontic K-files. Material and Methods: Antimicrobial activities of PA, isopropyl alcohol and acetone were compared against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, vancomycin resistant E. faecalis (VRE) and meticillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA), using minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and time-kill assays. Test solutions at different exposure times (15 s and 30 s) were assessed for treatment of endodontic files acting as carriers of E. faecalis-contaminated dental debris. Results: All bacteria were susceptible to PA (MBC range 0.25-1%), acetone (MBC range 50-60%) and isopropyl alcohol (30-40%). Using a time-kill assay of the antimicrobials at the determined MBC, all test microorganisms, with the exception of E. faecalis (VRE) 7766 were killed after 15 s exposure. In the case of E. faecalis 7766, viable cells remained detectable after 120 s exposure to acetone. Testing disinfection of endodontic K-files, previously coated with dental debris containing E. faecalis, it was found that PA (2%) completely killed E. faecalis after 15 s exposure. However, even after 30 s exposure, isopropyl alcohol (80%) and acetone (80%) had limited disinfecting activity. Conclusion: Extrapolation of these results to clinical practice would suggest that PA would be the most effective agent for trans-operative disinfection of endodontic K-files during treatment of a single patient

basic summary: Antimicrobial activity of Isopropyl Alcohol (80%), Acetone (80%) and Peracetic acid (2%) on K-files (carrier test) contaminated with E. faecalis grown in biofilms on dentin matrix (percentage of elimination). Objective: To compare the antimicrobial activi ty of peracetic acid (PA), isopropyl alcohol and acetone against a range of bacteria and also for disinfection of contaminated endodontic K-files. In this study, sessile E. faecalis removed from dentine walls by K-files used in the carrier test, exhibited resistance to acetone and isopropyl alcohol after 30 s exposure. Table.2: Disinfectant activity (time kill assay) after exposure to acetone (97%), isopropyl alcohol (98%) and peracetic acid (2%). Testing disinfection of endodontic K- files, previously coated with dental debris containing E. faecalis, it was found that PA (2%) completely killed E. faecalis after 15 s exposure. Test solutions at different exposure times (15 s and 30 s) were assessed for treatment of endodontic files acting as carriers of E. faecalis-contaminated dental debris. In these experiments, exposure to isopropyl alcohol for 30 s was more effective than for acetone (p<0.05, chi-square test). Contact with acetone, isopropyl alcohol, or 2% PA resulted in a total kill (<3.3×102 CFU/ml; minimum level of detection of viable cells in this assay) after 15 s exposure. Whilst isopropyl alcohol and acetone are ineffective at killing bacterial spores, maintenance of decontamination of instruments by vegetative organisms should be achievable by these agents . MATERIAL AND METHODS Test solutions used were 2% peracetic acid (PA) (SekuseptTMAktiv - Henkel AG & Co. KGaA, Düsseldorf, DE), acetone (>97%) and isopropyl alcohol/isopropanol (>98%).

sim_matrix summary: Assessment of     disinfection and  sterilization processes in dental practice as an  important factors in prevention of infections. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate and  compare the antimicrobial activity of PA, isopropyl  alcohol (isopropanol) and acetone (propanone) against  a  range of bacteria and also for the disinfection of  contaminated endodontic K-files. Chemical  disinfection and antiseptics – Quantitative  suspension test for the evaluation of bacterial  activity of chemical disinfectants and antiseptics  used in food, industrial, domestic and institutional  areas – Test method and requirements (phase 2, step  1) Brussels: European Committee for  Standardization 1997. Significantly,  total elimination of microbial viability occurred with  sessile cells derived from dentinal matrices for all K-file  carriers (100%) after 15 s exposure[25-27].PA is an  oxidizing agent used in the decontamination of a wide  range of medical equipment as well as in food and water  treatment processes10. During  single endodontic therapy, residual material can  accumulate on the working surface of an endodontic  instrument and maintenance of effective instrument  disinfection during the treatment session is an important  consideration[8,9]. Material and Methods:  Antimicrobial activities of PA, isopropyl alcohol and  acetone were compared against Staphylococcus aureus,  Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas  aeruginosa, vancomycin resistant E. faecalis (VRE) and  meticillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA), using minimum  bactericidal concentration (MBC) and time-kill assays. V. CONCLUSION  Based on the study findings, it was concluded that PA  was the most effective of the test disinfectants and as such  is advocated as an appropriate disinfectant for single use  endodontic instruments during use in a single treatment  session. A reduction in bacterial  viability higher than 105 CFU/ml was observed for all test  solutions, indicating that the chemicals had adequate  disinfecting activity for planktonically grown Gram- negative and Gram-positive bacteria after exposure for 15  s. The only exception was VRE 7766 which, by time kill  assay, demonstrated a residual number of viable cells  (2.3× 104 CFU/mL) after exposure of ~1011 CFU/ml to  concentrated acetone[16,17,22,23]. Experimental  evaluation of cyclic fatigue resistance of four  different nickel-titanium instruments after  immersion in sodium hypochlorite and/or  sterilization. A 100-µL volume of  double strength tryptone sodium chloride (TSC; 1g/L  Tryptone (Difco), sodium chloride (Merck) 8.5g/L) was  then added as a neutralizingagent, bacterial viability was  then determined by plating 10 µL portions of serial  decimally diluted preparations in TSC on to an  appropriate agar media and incubating for 24-48 h at  37oC.

Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 (OD660nm=0.5, 100-µL) was inoculated into the test tubes to generate a biofilm on the dentinal surfaces [15]. Material and Methods: Antimicrobial activities of PA, isopropyl alcohol and acetone were compared against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, vancomycin resistant E. faecalis (VRE) and meticillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA), using minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and time-kill assays. Although stated as disinfectants [22], to our knowledge, relatively few reports have tested the sensitivity of bacteria to both isopropyl alcohol and acetone, motivating inclusion of these agents in comparable tests with PA. This was particularly evident when contaminated K-files were dried prior to exposure to the disinfectant, even at higher concentrations. Moreover, isopropyl alcohol-based hand antiseptics have demonstrated higher activity against E. coli, Micrococcus luteus, and S. aureus than ethanol-based disinfectants in experiments on skin surfaces[27]. This recalcitrance of biofilms makes them extremely difficult to treat[23]. Contact with acetone, isopropyl alcohol, or 2% PA resulted in a total kill (<3.3×102 CFU/ml; minimum level of detection of viable cells in this assay) after 15 s exposure. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antimicrobial activity of PA, isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol) and acetone (propanone) against a range of bacteria and also for the disinfection of contaminated endodontic K-files. The approaches used to clean endodontic instruments are generally ineffective for the removal of biological debris, and therefore, single use instruments are advocated to avoid cross-infection occurring between patients6.

Title: Types of Scientific Collaborators: A Perspective of Author Contribution Network
Word count: 1043
Abstract: The purpose of this study is to investigate interaction between collaborators within individual studies by measuring how they made contributions to their studies. Author contribution network is constructed based on the author contribution statements of 140,000 full-text articles in PloS by viewing every collaborator as a node and a shared contribution as an edge. Three types of contributors are identified: general team-players, factotums, and mavericks. The preliminary result suggests that division of labor widely exists in scientific re-search and the latter two types of collaborators are common in small teams

basic summary: 4 Conclusion This study utilizes the author contribution statements embedded in full-text articles to build an author contribution network for every single study. 2.3 Three types of collaborators Based on the constructed author contribution network, three types of collaborators are exemplified in Fig. In an author contribution network, factotums, thus, are the nodes with both self- looped edge(s) and edge(s) connected to other node(s) (e.g., C2). It also suggests that most collaborators in research teams are team-players, who share tasks; then follow the factotums; and, lastly mavericks are least common collaborators.

Abstract: Community archives have gained renewed attention as an emerging archival movement. The goal of this study is to map the intellectual structure of community-centric archival research during the 2000-2017 period. To identify and visualize the relationships between topics within the subject areas, we analyzed the co-occurrence index and network structures of keywords derived from titles, abstracts, and author-provided keywords in peer-reviewed journal articles and conference proceedings in the field of community archives

To aid us in this  search, we used the following search terms when searching the databases: community  archive(s), non-institutional archive(s), participatory archive(s), grassroots archive(s),  activist archive(s), autonomous archive(s), ethnic archive(s), oral history archive(s),  and local history project(s). The 2006-2011 period data, with 148 nodes and 4,068 edges, reveals a growing pres- ence of indigenous perspectives and cultural diversity in the literature as seen in the  emergence of terms like “indigenous people” and “queer archive.” Further, this period  marked the rise of research on non-traditional archival materials as represented by the  terms “music archive,” “film,” “sound archive,” and “audiovisual archive.” We also  observed that the term “community archive” has moved to the core of the network since  this period (degree of centrality: 10 -> 128 -> 466).

Title: Toward an Understanding of Data Literacy
Word count: 1427
Abstract: As the interest in data grows, much attention has been paid to data literacy, and multiple perspectives and understandings to define data literacy have emerged from varying conceptual contexts. However, there remains a lack of agreement regarding the scope of data literacy across disciplines. This study attempts to define data literacy holistically through a meta-synthesis approach. The study found three distinct themes for data literacy: as skills required for data-driven decision making, as activities for research data services, and a set of practices for data lifecycle
basic similarity: 0.7028641348196903
basic summary: Such activities and practices include data creation, data acquisition, data normalization, data analytics, data storage, data disposal, and data use/re-use. The primary search terms used to locate relevant articles were any derivative forms of data – i.e., data, big data, research data, etc. As the interest in data grows, much attention has been paid to data literacy, and multiple perspectives and understandings to define data literacy have emerged from varying conceptual contexts. This defini- tion of data literacy considers a set activities and practices undertaken in the production, consumption, and management of data through the data lifecycle.

sim_matrix summary: (2011)  Components of data literacy competency include: “discovery and ac- quisition; databases and data formats; data conversion and interopera- bility; data processing and analysis; data visualization and representa- tion; data management & organization; data quality and documentation;  metadata and description; cultures of practice; ethics & attribution; data  curation and re-use; and data preservation.”  Matthews (2016) “…a set of practical competencies situated in a wider context of per- sonal and social goals, as well as challenges such as subjectivity and  bias.”   Maybee & Zilinski  (2015)  Comprised of “skills related to accessing, managing, communicating,  preserving and ethically using data.”  4  Okamoto (2017) “…The ability to access, critically assess, interpret, manipulate, man- age, summarize, handle, present, and ethically use data.”   4 Conclusion  The preliminary results of the meta-synthesis reveal that data literacy has multiple fac- ets and is applied with reference to its actions, objective, and context. Data literacy as activities supporting research data services  Koltay (2016) “…Is closely related to research data services that include research data  management.”   Prado & Marzal  (2013)   “…Enables individuals to access, interpret, critically assess, manage,  handle and ethically use data.”   Qin & D’Ignazio  (2010)  “…Knowledge and skills in collecting, processing, managing, evaluat- ing, and using data for scientific inquiry.”  Searle et al. (2015)    Identified as “one of the research data service activities that support  researchers in building the skills and knowledge required to manage  data well.”  3.3 Data Literacy as a Set of Practices for Data Lifecycle  The last definition is a combination of the two definitions discussed so far. (2017)        “…Data literate reader has the ability to properly evaluate the evidence  that is presented in these scenarios, so that they can make critical judg- ments on the reliability of the information presented and can better un- derstand how their own contributed data is being utilized and make  more informed decisions.”   3  3.2 Data Literacy as Activities Supporting Research Data Services  Since the emergence of e-science and cyberinfrastructure, data literacy has been  recognized as one of the critical building blocks in the knowledge base of information  professionals involved in supporting research data management and curation (Koltay,  2016).

frequency summary: As such programs have been  structured on the belief that there is great potential to match existing librarians’  expertise in information literacy with support for e-science, data literacy is often  viewed as a logical extension of the information literacy concept or as a sub-discipline  of information literacy (Schneider, 2013). (2011)  Components of data literacy competency include: “discovery and ac- quisition; databases and data formats; data conversion and interopera- bility; data processing and analysis; data visualization and representa- tion; data management & organization; data quality and documentation;  metadata and description; cultures of practice; ethics & attribution; data  curation and re-use; and data preservation.”  Matthews (2016) “…a set of practical competencies situated in a wider context of per- sonal and social goals, as well as challenges such as subjectivity and  bias.”   Maybee & Zilinski  (2015)  Comprised of “skills related to accessing, managing, communicating,  preserving and ethically using data.”  4  Okamoto (2017) “…The ability to access, critically assess, interpret, manipulate, man- age, summarize, handle, present, and ethically use data.”   4 Conclusion  The preliminary results of the meta-synthesis reveal that data literacy has multiple fac- ets and is applied with reference to its actions, objective, and context. (2017)        “…Data literate reader has the ability to properly evaluate the evidence  that is presented in these scenarios, so that they can make critical judg- ments on the reliability of the information presented and can better un- derstand how their own contributed data is being utilized and make  more informed decisions.”   3  3.2 Data Literacy as Activities Supporting Research Data Services  Since the emergence of e-science and cyberinfrastructure, data literacy has been  recognized as one of the critical building blocks in the knowledge base of information  professionals involved in supporting research data management and curation (Koltay,  2016). Data literacy as activities supporting research data services  Koltay (2016) “…Is closely related to research data services that include research data  management.”   Prado & Marzal  (2013)   “…Enables individuals to access, interpret, critically assess, manage,  handle and ethically use data.”   Qin & D’Ignazio  (2010)  “…Knowledge and skills in collecting, processing, managing, evaluat- ing, and using data for scientific inquiry.”  Searle et al.

Title: Creating A Disability Corpus for Literary Analysis: Pilot Classification Experiments
Word count: 1350
Abstract: As literary text opens to researchers for distant reading, the computational analysis of large corpora of text for literary scholarship, problems beyond typical data science roadblocks, such as data scale and statistical significance of findings have emerged. For scholars studying character and social representation in literature, the identification of characters within the given classes of study is crucial, painstaking, and often a manual process. However, for characters with disabilities, manual identification is prohibitively difficult to undertake at scale, and especially challenging given the coded textual markers that can be used to refer to disability. There currently exists no corpus of characters in fiction with disabilities, which is the first step to at-scale computational study of this topic. This project seeks to pilot a classification process using manually assigned ground truth on a subset of volumes from the HathiTrust. Having successfully built and evaluated a Naïve Bayes classifier, we suggest full-scale deployment of a statistical classifier on a large corpus of literature in order to assemble a disability corpus. This project also covers preliminary exploratory textual analysis of characters with disabilities to yield potential research questions for further exploration

basic summary: This yielded a final dataset with a total of 119 characters, including 7,079 words for characters with disabilities and 5,819 words for characters without. This project is focused on using distant reading techniques to identify and study characters with disabilities in fiction, a relatively unexplored area of study, and one with unique challenges. Characters with disabilities have an average sentiment 2.5 times more negative than characters without. 2 Methods Using manual identification of characters with disabilities, we compiled a list of 28 novels that had at least one character with a disability. This pilot project and any resulting corpus could also serve as a first step to finer-grained identification of characters with disabilities in literature. For scholars studying character and social representation in literature, the identification of characters within the given classes of study is crucial, painstaking, and often a manual process. There currently exists no corpus of characters in fiction with disabilities, which is the first step to at-scale computational study of this topic.

Title: Mathematicians’ Central Role in Educating the STEM Workforce
Word count: 919
Abstract: In the recent report Engage to Excel,1 President Obama’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) identifies mathematics as a bottleneck in undergraduate Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education. Among PCAST’s recommendations are onescalling for the development and teaching of college-level mathematics courses “by faculty from mathematics-intensive disciplines other than mathematics” and for “a new pathway for producing K–12 mathematics teachers…in programs in mathematics-intensive fields other than mathematics.”2 While we are in sharp disagreement with these specific recommendations, we do share PCAST’s concern for the state of STEM education. We encourage the mathematicscommunity to focus constructively on the broad view the report sketches. We appeal to the community to amplify its communications with other STEM disciplines, to publicize its teaching innovations, and to redouble its efforts to meet the challenges discussed by PCAST

basic summary: In order to reach as many students as possible, education in entry-level college mathematics must continue to evolve. Mathematicians guide students to explore their ideas using skills that apply beyond immediate problems; we facilitate students’ efforts to understand the principles and logic that underpin applications. We firmly assert that it is essential that mathemati- cians be actively engaged in the planning and teaching of the mathematics courses that form the foundation of STEM education. A solid foundation in mathematics is essential for successful STEM education, for this paves the way for flexibility in a changing workforce environment.

Title: Measurement of the parity violating asymmetry in the quasielastic electron-deuteron scattering and improved determination of the magnetic strange form factor and the isovector anapole radiative correction
Word count: 3057
Abstract: A new measurement of the parity-violating asymmetry in the electron-deuteron quasielastic scattering for backward angles at ⟨Q[superscript 2]⟩=0.224 (GeV/c)[superscript 2], obtained in the A4 experiment at the Mainz Microtron accelerator (MAMI) facility, is presented. The measured asymmetry is A[subscript PV][superscript d]=(-20.11±0.87[subscript stat]±1.03[subscript sys])×10[superscript -6]. A combination of these data with the proton measurements of the parity-violating asymmetry in the A4 experiment yields a value for the effective isovector axial-vector form factor of G[subscript A][superscript e,(T=1)]=-0.19±0.43 and R[subscript A][superscript e(T=1),anap] =-0.41±0.35 for the anapole radiative correction. When combined with a reanalysis of measurements obtained in the G0 experiment at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, the uncertainties are further reduced to G[subscript M][superscript s]=0.17±0.11 for the magnetic strange form factors, and R[subscript A][superscript (T=1),anap]=-0.54±0.26.Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaf

Future measurements of APV in the A4 experiment at Q2 ¼ 0.1 ðGeV=cÞ2 will help to further reduce the errors of GsM, G e;ðT¼1Þ A , G e;ðT¼0Þ A , R ðT¼1Þ;anap A and R ðT¼0Þ;anap A .

False asymmetries originate from helicity-correlated beam differences of energy, position, angle and intensity. AiPV shows no significant dependence on the azimuthal angle. Its effect, however, cannot be calculated using perturbative methods of the QCD theory.

Title: SNP Genotyping Defines Complex Gene-Flow Boundaries Among African Malaria Vector Mosquitoes
Word count: 3303
Abstract: Mosquitoes in the Anopheles gambiae complex show rapid ecological and behavioral diversification, traits that promote malaria transmission and complicate vector control efforts. A high-density, genome-wide mosquito SNP-genotyping array allowed mapping of genomic differentiation between populations and species that exhibit varying levels of reproductive isolation. Regions near centromeres or within polymorphic inversions exhibited the greatest genetic divergence, but divergence was also observed elsewhere in the genomes. Signals of natural selection within populations were overrepresented among genomic regions that are differentiated between populations, implying that differentiation is often driven by population-specific selective events. Complex genomic differentiation among speciating vector mosquito populations implies that tools for genome-wide monitoring of population structure will prove useful for the advancement of malaria eradication

Title: On the Green functions of gravitational radiation theory
Word count: 3184
Abstract: Previous work in the literature has studied gravitational radiation inblack-hole collisions at the speed of light. In particular, it had been provedthat the perturbative field equations may all be reduced to equations in onlytwo independent variables, by virtue of a conformal symmetry at each order inperturbation theory. The Green function for the perturbative field equations ishere analyzed by studying the corresponding second-order hyperbolic operatorwith variable coefficients, instead of using the reduction method from theretarded flat-space Green function in four dimensions. After reduction tocanonical form of this hyperbolic operator, the integral representation of thesolution in terms of the Riemann function is obtained. The Riemann functionsolves a characteristic initial-value problem for which analytic formulaeleading to the numerical solution are derived.Comment: 15 pages, plain Tex.

sim_matrix summary: Reduction to two dimensions and the associated operator As is well known from the work in [6] and [8], the field equations for the first-order cor- rection h (1) ab in the expansion (1.1) are particular cases of the general system given by the flat-space wave equation (here u ≡ 1√ 2 (z + t), v ≡ 1√ 2 (z − t)) ψ = 2 ∂2ψ ∂u∂v + 1 ρ ∂ ∂ρ ( ρ ∂ψ ∂ρ ) + 1 ρ2 ∂2ψ ∂φ2 = 0 (2.1) supplemented by the boundary condition ψ(u = 0) = eimφρ−nf [8 log(vρ)− √ 2v] (2.2a) 3 f(x) = 0 ∀x < 0. (4.4) Thus, on defining U ≡ R (4.5) V ≡ Rx +BR (4.6) the equation (4.1) for the Riemann function is equivalent to the hyperbolic canonical system [11] Ux = f1(x, y)U + f2(x, y)V (4.7) Vy = g1(x, y)U + g2(x, y)V (4.8) where f1 ≡ −B = b (4.9) f2 = 1 (4.10) g1 ≡ AB − C +By = ab− c+ ax (4.11) g2 ≡ −A = a. (3.4) The dependence of t on x and y is obtained implicitly by solving the system [6, 8] x = r + log ( t− 1 2 ) − 8 (t− 1) − 4 (3.5) y = r + log ( t+ 1 2 ) + 8 (t+ 1) − 4. 8 In the (x, y) variables, the operator Lm,n reads therefore Lm,n = f(x, y) ∂ 2 ∂x∂y + g(x, y) ∂ ∂x + h(x, y) ∂ ∂y + n2 −m2 (3.16) where, exploiting the formulae ∂x ∂q = 64 √ 2 (t− 1)2 (3.2b) ∂y ∂q = 64 √ 2 (t+ 1)2 (3.3b) one finds f(x, y) = −(2 √ 2 + 32q) ( ∂x ∂q + ∂y ∂q ) + 8q2 ∂x ∂q ∂y ∂q + 128 = 256 [ 1− 2t 2(t2 + 1) (t− 1)2(t+ 1)2 ] (3.17) g(x, y) = 4(n+ 1)q ∂x ∂q − 16n = 16 [ 1 + 2(n+ 1) (t− 1) ] (3.18) h(x, y) = 4(n+ 1)q ∂y ∂q − 16n = 16 [ 1− 2(n+ 1) (t+ 1) ] . (3.7b) This suggests defining w ≡ (t− 1) (t+ 1) (3.8) so that one first has to solve the transcendental equation we (w2−1) 2w = e (x−y) 8 (3.9) to obtain w = w(x− y), from which one gets t = (1 + w) (1− w) = t(x− y). This leads to the following equation for χ ≡ e−imφρnψ: Lm,nχ(q, r) = H(q, r) (2.6) where Lm,n is an hyperbolic operator in the independent variables q and r, and takes the form [6, 8] Lm,n = −(2 √ 2 + 32q) ∂2 ∂q∂r + 4q2 ∂2 ∂q2 + 64 ∂2 ∂r2 + 4(n+ 1)q ∂ ∂q − 16n ∂ ∂r + n2 −m2. (3.26) is a canonical hyperbolic equation of the form ( ∂2 ∂x∂y + A ∂ ∂x +B ∂ ∂y + C ) R(x, y; ξ, η) = 0 (4.1) where A ≡ −a (4.2) B ≡ −b (4.3) 11 C ≡ c− ax − by.

(2.14) This suggests defining yet new variables X ≡ α+R (2.15) Y ≡ α−R (2.16) so that ∂2 ∂α∂R = ∂2 ∂X2 − ∂ 2 ∂Y 2 (2.17) 5 ∂2 ∂α2 + ∂2 ∂R2 = 2 ( ∂2 ∂X2 + ∂2 ∂Y 2 ) (2.18) ∂ ∂α − ∂ ∂R = 2 ∂ ∂Y (2.19) and hence Lm,n reads eventually Tm,n = 16 ∂2 ∂Y 2 + 8n ∂ ∂Y + n2 −m2 − 1√ 2 e−(X+Y )/2 ( ∂2 ∂X2 − ∂ 2 ∂Y 2 ) (2.20) with Green function satisfying the equation Tm,nGm,n ( e X+Y 2 , 2(X − Y ); eX0+Y02 , 2(X0 − Y0) ) = 1 2 δ ( e X+Y 2 − eX0+Y02 ) δ((X − Y )− (X0 − Y0)). For this purpose, recall from [11] that, on denoting by L† the adjoint of the operator L in (3.20), which acts according to L†[χ] = χxy − (aχ)x − (bχ)y + cχ (3.25) one has to find a ‘function’ R(x, y; ξ, η) (actually a kernel) subject to the following condi- tions ((ξ, η) being the coordinates of a point P such that characteristics through it intersect a curve C at points A and B, AP being a segment with constant y, and BP being a segment with constant x): (i) As a function of x and y, R satisfies the adjoint equation L†(x,y)[R] = 0 (3.26) (ii) Rx = bR on AP , i.e. (3.13) One therefore has g′(w) > 0 for all w > 0, and g′(w) < 0 for all w ∈ (−∞, 0)− {−1}, and g is monotonically decreasing for negative w and monotonically increasing for positive w. The point w = −1, at which g′(w) vanishes, is neither a maximum nor a minimum point, because g′′(w) = ( 1 4w3 + 1 2w + 1 + w 4 ) e (w2−1) 2w (3.14) g′′′(w) = ( 1 8w5 − 3 4w4 + 3 8w3 + 3 8w + 3 4 + w 8 ) e (w2−1) 2w . (4.4) Thus, on defining U ≡ R (4.5) V ≡ Rx +BR (4.6) the equation (4.1) for the Riemann function is equivalent to the hyperbolic canonical system [11] Ux = f1(x, y)U + f2(x, y)V (4.7) Vy = g1(x, y)U + g2(x, y)V (4.8) where f1 ≡ −B = b (4.9) f2 = 1 (4.10) g1 ≡ AB − C +By = ab− c+ ax (4.11) g2 ≡ −A = a. 4 Since we are interested in a direct approach to the evaluation of the Green function Gm,n in the (q, r) coordinates, we begin by noticing that, in all derivatives which are not mixed, the operator Lm,n can be made a constant coefficient operator upon setting α ≡ log(q) (2.9) which implies q ∂ ∂q = ∂ ∂α (2.10) q2 ∂2 ∂q2 = ∂2 ∂α2 − ∂ ∂α (2.11) and hence Lm,n = −(2 √ 2e−α + 32) ∂2 ∂α∂r + 4 ∂2 ∂α2 + 64 ∂2 ∂r2 + 4n ∂ ∂α − 16n ∂ ∂r + n2 −m2.

Title: Повседневность в рассказах Бориса Екимова
Word count: 3348
Abstract: Boris Ekimov’s stories of the 2000s which formed the collection “Saturday of Souls” are analyzedin the present article. The writer doesn’t set the purpose to recreate peasants’ Atlantis but perceivestoday of the village as a reality in which a person lives.The concepts of “daily life” and “daily occurrence” are differentiated in the article as the ones thathave different extension and occur at different times. Daily life is classified as sacral, it is one ofthe manifestations of existence, while daily occurrence assumes an appeal to the private life of anordinary person in the present and his/her inclusiveness into the civilized everyday life.The study of the everyday life of B. Ekimov’s characters that allowed him to describe the current stateof the village, which is characterized by the daily life coordinates reduction, has become the purposeof this article. The deformed connections between people in the literary world of the writer are, firstof all, demonstrated in the transformation of the image of the master and changes in the character ofthe neighborhood relationsВ настоящей статье анализируются рассказы Бориса Екимова 2000-х годов, составившихсборник «Родительская суббота». Писатель не ставит целью воссоздать крестьянскую Атлантиду, а воспринимает сегодняшний день деревни как данность, в которой живет человек.В статье разграничиваются понятия «быт» и «повседневность» как разнообъемные и разновременные. Быт отнесен к сакральному, это одно из проявлений бытия, повседневность жепредполагает обращение к приватной жизни обычного человека в настоящем, его включенность в цивилизационный обиход.Целью статьи стало исследование повседневной жизни героев Б. Екимова, позволяющей емуописать современное состояние деревни, характеризующееся редуцированностью бытийных координат. В художественном мире писателя деформированные связи между людьми проявляются, в первую очередь, в трансформации образа хозяина и изменении характера соседских отношений

basic summary: A striking feature of B. Ekimov’s style is the power of observation, loyalty to the “truth of life”, attention to details and ins and outs of daily life. From the author’s point of view, “daily life” and “daily occurrence” are the concepts that have different extension and occur at different times. The concepts of “daily life” and “daily occurrence” are differentiated in the article as the ones that have different extension and occur at different times. Keywords: daily occurrence, daily life, Boris Ekimov’s prose, Ekimov’s character, modern village. At the same time, in V. Dal’s dictionary, “daily life” includes the possibility of the “daily occurrence” emergence in its modern understanding. In his literary world ontological coexists with historical and social, and daily life with daily occurrence. B. Ekimov, thus, shows a multicomponent village life in which the polar images of life order, evaluated by the participants as self-sufficient, coexist.

sim_matrix summary: Its merits include the  combination of “the increased poetic sentiment  of narration with the sobriety and acuity  of social vision” (Skarlygina, 1987: 228),  “attention to the exact details of the life of the  earth and its living world” (Bogatko, 1990:  296), interest to the “spiritually significant”  (Rodnianskaia, 1996: 240), “authenticity of the  depicted” and “conscientious attitude to life”  (Udin, 1988: 130), “absolute truthfulness, moral  purity of the author’s attitude”, “depictive talent”  (Serdiuchenko, 2000: 95) and mythopoetics  (Kovtun, 2013: 411-427). In the context  of the collection of stories it is permissible to talk  not about trying to reconstruct the former way  of life, but rather about reflections on tomorrow,  about what the life of the village will be like:  in the triumph of everyday life, or “Saturday of  Souls” will also remain? The source  of the organized life of the latter is not only the  readiness to work hard, but also the absence of  moral barriers: “day and night the stream flows  from the moonshine still”, the character has  no morals in taking stolen things, “evaluating  everything in a kopeck”. In N. Rubtsov’s  poems remoteness of the farmstead from the  civilization is a condition of the closed nature  and secrecy of the world, while in B. Ekimov’s  stories it becomes a sign of the substandard living  conditions in the modern village. Former neighbors are as family members, they  are sympathetic, hospitable, share misfortunes  and joys, they know the art of shared households  (they live in accordance with the principle: it  is better to hurt themselves than to harm the  neighbor) and they are included into the space  of the house. Lotman continued the idea of V. Dal, but there  was already less sacral meaning in the definition  of daily life: “... not only the life of things, these  are customs, the whole ritual of daily behavior and  the order of life that determine the daily routine,  the time of various occupations, the nature of  work and leisure, the forms of recreation, games,  love ritual and funeral rites” (Lotman, 1994: 12). “The task of the writer is to  study the ways of survival for the people under  the conditions of the destruction of the global  myth about the selectness of the Russian land,  the single national house-temple” (Kovtun, 2013:  339).

Ekimov records the change in the spatial coordinates of the village: “The farm had a big name – Bol’shye Chapury. The peculiarity of the writer’s literary work is largely determined by the appeal to the topic of the modern village and the related topics of peasant labor, memory and the connection of generations, to the issues of the meaning and value of existence, life and death.

Strukova) insist on the correspondence of these  concepts based on the principle of particular  (“daily life”) and universal (“daily occurrence”). Lotman continued the idea of V.

Title: Towards a more investment friendly economic incentive regime for offshore infrastructure projects
Word count: 2000
Abstract: Offshore infrastructure projects will play a key role in enabling the EU to meet its renewable energy goals. Therefore, effective economic incentives must be in place to ensure adequate investments. • Since the liberalisation of the power sector, the use of ‘incentive regulation’ has become a standard practice among European regulators. This TSO incentive regulation is done in a ‘portfolio’ fashion. • In the countries analysed, different risk/remuneration profiles are set according to the general regulatory regimes. These risk/remuneration profiles have not changed significantly since the previous study conducted by Glachant et al. (2013). 1 • Nevertheless, in recent years, regulators are also providing dedicated incentives for specific strategically important or necessary investments, including offshore projects. • We observe that the trend of providing dedicated incentives appears to modify the risk/remuneration characteristics, leading to a more ‘investment friendly’ environment for TSOs, at least for certain types of assets, such as offshore transmission infrastructures

Title: Social media : Third-person perceptions of architecture
Word count: 2839
Abstract: Perceptions of architecture vary depending on the reader. This study is based on an experiment involving social media. A provocative architectural photomontage is shared on Facebook without using the sponsored feature. Inputs, notably ‘Likes’ and ‘Comments’, received within 24 hours from posting were analysed. Unlike respondents who are involved in architecture, the general public is afraid of innovative design, departing from the prescriptive formal and informal norms, the comfort zone. The emphasis of the public is the utilitarian rather than the aesthetic dimension of architecture.peer-reviewe

Title: Generational differences in achieving work-life balance
Word count: 991
Abstract: Each generation is influenced by broad forces that create common value systems distinguishing them from people who grew up at different times. Reaching balance between life and work is an intangible ideal considered to be a complete fairytale. But by making deliberate choices about which opportunities they’ll pursue and which they’ll decline, rather than simply reacting to emergencies, leaders can and do engage meaningfully with work, family, and community

Title: SMEs Empowerment Through International Aspirations
Word count: 1172
Abstract: Challenges for SMEs development are multi-dimensional. As trade barriers, transport and communication costs fall, SMEs are required to add more value to their products to stay ahead and compete with lower cost rivals. Consumer demand is changing rapidly as incomes rise and choices increase when imported products become easily available in domestic markets. Competition within the developing world for export markets, foreign investment and resources is also intensifying. This was motivation to focus in this paper on SMEs, its export competitiveness, business strategies, access for financing and so on. Enhancing SME competitiveness requires creation of enabling legal, regulatory and administrative environments and capable institutional structures, and most importantly human capital and a sustainable environment. Removing supply-side constraint to trade and investment, require firms to build up their competitive advantages. Public and private sectors in transition and developing countries must work together to improve the functioning of markets at home, while intensifying efforts to integrate into the world economy

Wignaraja, Ganeshan (2003), “Promoting SME Exports from Developing Countries” paper presented at the Regional Workshop on Trade Capacity Building and Private Sector Development in Asia. SME development cuts across sectors, involves multiple stakeholders and necessitates concerted actions by the public and private sectors. There is evidence that a growing number of medium sized firms, in particular, are internationalising their operations as a strategic response to increasing competitive pressure. SMEs can face difficulties in financing international activity, identifying opportunities and making appropriate contacts in their target markets.

Title: A Time-Independent Approach to Evaluate the Kinetics of \udEnzyme-Substrate Reactions in Cyclic Staircase Voltammetry
Word count: 3323
Abstract: In  this  work  we  refer  to  a  simple  and  time-independent  cyclovoltammetric approach for evaluating kinetics of chemical step of a diffusional electrocatalytic regenerative (EC’) mechanism. The methodology relies on the dependence of the maximal catalytic (or limiting)   current   of   the   cyclic   steady-state   voltammograms   on   the   catalyzing   agent concentration.  The  magnitude  of  the  limiting  cyclovoltammetric  current  of  an  EC’  mechanism depends exclusively on the rate of the chemical regenerative reaction, while it is independent  on  all  kinetic  and  thermodynamic  parameters  related  to  the electrode  reaction.  Theoretical results of a quasireversible EC’ mechanism reveal that the limiting current of calculated cyclic voltammograms is a linear function of the square-root of the dimensionless catalytic  rate  parameter.  Because  the  rate  of  the  catalytic  reaction  can  experimentally  be  modified by altering the concentration of the regenerating agent (for constant scan rate), this scenario  can  be  explored  for  the  determination  of  the  catalytic  rate  constant.  The  approach described  in  this  work  is  important  for  the  enzyme-substrate  catalytic  reactions,  since  the value of the catalytic rate constant allows estimation of the Michaelis-Menten constant

Title: Building Linkage Between FDU and Exports of Macedonian Products
Word count: 2436
Abstract: Prices of domestic products on international markets are often underestimated because of the poor reputation or ranking the products with a low degree of processing. Namely, it is necessary small and medium enterprises to make efforts in this domain to contribute in a way that they will make the promotion of domestic products, have organized a joint presentation on external markets, will exhibit initiatives for creation of distribution centers. In this regard, the entry of FDI in manufacturing is expected to contribute to the production of high quality products, and distinctive products, which would lead to higher absolute prices, higher productivity and lower unit labor costs of products. This paper aims to focus on contribution for developing the strategies that could help to strengthen the SME sector. From one side it could be done through their promoting of integration into, and potential benefits from external markets. Implementation of the strategies should increase the attractiveness of the transition and developing countries for foreign investors which will improve the capacity of the SME sector. From the other side, the policies will strengthen the benefits from FDI to local economies trough facilitation of SME trade and capacity building of local SMEs to use the opportunities from the external markets

basic summary: Thus, Podravka (a food company) already has part of its production facilities in Macedonia, and Vindija (dairy products company) is investing in increasing its production facilities in Serbia. Key policy issues are related with creating conditions to attract foreign investors together with policies to encourage and facilitate different forms of cooperation between inward investors and domestic SMEs. Yet many Croatian companies report that they don’t let prices in the CEFTA market rise due to the new tariffs and quotas; instead, they would accommodate the costs. Conclusion Macedonian business are too looking forward to increasing exports in the region, as well as, becoming more competitive on the domestic market. Some Croatian factories have already acted to move part of their production facilities to the CEFTA countries, mainly to Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Title: Effect of Competing Cations (Cu, Zn, Mn, Pb) Adsorbed by Zeolite Bearing Tuff from Macedonia
Word count: 2322
Abstract: Zeolite bearing tuff (stilbite 27%) from Vetunica deposit, Republic of Macedonia was investigated as an adsorbent for removal of copper, zinc, manganese and lead ions from synthetic aqueous solutions. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the presence of competing cations on the individual adsorption of Cu2+, Pb2+, Zn2+ and Mn2+ from a solution containing a mixture of all these metal ions, by zeolite bearing tuff. The obtained results show that the adsorption of studied ions in single and multi-component solution onto zeolite bearing tuff occurs efficiently. The amount adsorbed from multicomponent solutions was affected significantly, except for Pb2+ where the difference between single and multi-component solution is minimal, almost insignificant. The selectivity of zeolite bearing tuff was also determined for the respective heavy metal ions. The selectivity series obtained for single and multi-component solution was: Pb2+ > Cu2+ > Zn2+ > Mn2+
basic similarity: 0.7054877314643613
basic summary: According to the hydration energies and hydration radii, the zeolite will prefer Pb over Cu, Mn and Zn in multi-com- ponent solutions. In addition, according to the maximum adsorption capacity (q e ), the selectivity of zeolite bearing tuff was determined for the respective heavy metal ions. The obtained results show that the adsorption of studied ions in single and multi-component solution onto zeolite bearing tuff occurs efficiently. This was done by comparing the maximum adsorption capacity (q e ) of zeolite bearing tuff for the respective heavy metal ion. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION All experiments for different heavy metal ions were carried Table 1: Chemical composition, density and porosity of zeolite bearing tuff. The selectivity of zeolite bearing tuff was also determined for the respective heavy metal ions.

sim_matrix summary: Experimental procedure: Adsorption of heavy metal ions on zeolite bearing tuff was performed with synthetic single and multi-component ion solutions of Cu2+, Zn2+ Mn2+ and Pb2+ with initial concentration of 25 mg/L. CONCLUSION The investigation for influence of the presence of compet- ing cations on the individual adsorption of Cu2+, Zn2+, Mn2+ and Pb2+ from a solution containing a mixture of these metal ions, by zeolite bearing tuff is done by comparing the ad- sorption of each heavy metal ion from both single and multi- component solutions. The obtained results show that the adsorption of studied ions in single and multi-component solution onto zeolite bearing tuff occurs efficiently. The selectivity of zeolite bearing tuff was also determined for the respective heavy metal ions. Moreover, the total amount of heavy metal ions adsorbed (all four cations) per unit mass of zeolite bearing tuff increased with multi-component solutions compared to the amount of solute adsorbed from single component solutions. In addition, according to the maximum adsorption capacity (q e ), the selectivity of zeolite bearing tuff was determined for the respective heavy metal ions.

Title: Acupuncture treatment in Bell’s palsy\ud
Word count: 1785
Abstract: Facial nerve is the 7th cranial nerve. The palsy of this nerve is often idiopathic and known as Bells’ Palsy, but not always this term is synonymous with idiopathic facial nerve palsy. There are two facial nerves one of each side of the face. Injury to the facial nerve can cause a social, psychological and physical defect. From the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), facial nerve palsy is caused by wind in the facial channels. The Chinese name is Zhong Feng which means Wind Attack. According to TCM the facial channels are full with normal healthy bodily substance. If the channels are not full, there is some deficiency of Blood, Qi or Yin and the wind may get into the channels. In this study are included 9 patients, 5 female and 4 male, on age from 8 to 47, all diagnosed with Bell’s palsy. All patients were treated with acupuncture in a clinic for TCM and acupuncture in Skopje, Macedonia by a doctor specialist in acupuncture. Despite the acupuncture treatments, patients were prescribed tablets by their doctors. With individual number of treatments, we succeeded to help the patients to heal naturally, regain the normal function of the facial muscles, restore the nerve function and improve the Qi and Blood circulation in the facial are

Title: Conditioned Extreme, Determination and Visualization
Word count: 1821
Abstract: In mathematics, and especially in the application of mathematics in a number of areas, problems and tasks are encountered in which extremes of function are required, with the variables being bound up with some additional conditions. Extremes of this kind are called conditional extremes. [2]. In this paper, we present the procedure for determining a conditional extremity of a function with two variables, we will present that the point is finding the curve in the space obtained as a cross section on two surfaces and by using free software we will have visualization of the conditional extremum.  Key words: Conditioned extreme, function, point, visualization

The derivation of the function after the variable x at the point of the conditional extremity should be 0 dz dx  . The equation (x,y) = 0 in the plane xOy is a curve, but represented in a space it is a surface C normal on the xOy plane.

text_rank summary: Method of direct elimination  The extreme value of the function z = f (x, y) under the condition (x,y) = 0 can be found such that y  is expressed from the equation (x,y) = 0 in the explicit form y = y (x) and is replaced in the function z = f  (x, y).(as described in some literature  sources [1], [2], [3], [4])  Let the function z = f (x, y) be given, where x and y are two independent variables that represent a  surface in space D. And let a certain condition (x,y) = 0 be given.In this way a function with one variable z = f (x, y (x)) is obtained, and the task is reduced to  determining the extreme value of a function of an independent variable.system equations are                                                                           0 0 ( , ) 0 z x x z y y x y                                                                                  (3)  System solutions give the values for x, y and  for which the function can have an extremal value at  the given condition.C surface intersects the  surface D on a curve L.  The solution to this problem is to find the point M (x0, y0) in the equation (x,y) = 0 in which the  function z = f (x, y) has an extreme value, [1], [2], [3], [4].

Then the procedure for determining the extremity of a function with one variable is used. The point M (x0, y0, z0) is called the point of the conditional extremity of the function z = f (x, y) and in the point M (x0, y0, z0) the function z = f (x, y) does not have an extreme value.

I  discuss  the rationales  in  revisiting The Elementary Forms, propose  two  ideas  of  revisits,  and  sketch an inventory of the sources to undertake them

basic summary: This material is not restricted to rel igious l ife, but rather covers social l ife with an emphasis on rel igion. Second, within sociology, The Elementary Forms not only offers theoretical inputs for the sociology of rel igion, but also the sociology of knowledge, classifications, and moral ity. I would title this revisit "An Inquiry into Rel igious Life in Austral ian Aboriginal Societies", or "An Inquiry into Rel igious Life in Melanesian Societ- ies".

text_rank summary: Durkheim provides a definition: We have arrived, then, at the fol lowing definition: a rel igion is a unified system of bel iefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is to say, things set apart and surrounded by prohibitions – bel iefs and practices that unite its adherents in a single moral community cal led a church (Durkheim, 2001 [1912]: 46) Fourth, far from being a source of error, rel igion is at the origin of scientific knowledge and cognitive classifications.(Durkheim, 2001 [1912]: 320) Second, rel igious l ife involves a fundamental separation between the sacred and the profane: There is no other example in the history of human thought of two categories of things so profoundly differentiated or so radical ly opposed to one another.In any case, I would stay true to Durkheim's l ifetime endeavor: demonstrate that even the most intimate things are deeply bound to society, uncover the mechanisms through which society weighs on the individual , and make the case for sociology as a science.

First, rel igious feel ings are the transfiguration of feel ings of social belonging, which the related rituals come to express and reinforce: While rel igion seems to dwel l entirely in the innermost self of the individual , the l iving spring that feeds it is sti l l to be found in society. * * * The first revisit would be a theoretical ly understated, grounded ethnographic description of rel igious l ife in the primitive societies covered in The Elementary Forms .

Title: On the critical mass of greenhouse gas
Word count: 4314
Abstract: In recent years, changes in the Earth’s climate have raised concern all around the globe. Climatologists have been drawing connections between global warming and a growing number of natural disasters, unexpected temperature fluctuations in some regions of the world and a number of other climatic aberrations. Within the scientific community, the opinions as to the nature and mechanism of the Earth’s climate change have split. Some contend that since the beginning of the industrial revolution, the carbon dioxide levels in the air have been steadily rising due to human production activities. Along with other gases, carbon dioxide has been inculpated for the greenhouse effect. In connection with this, a number of recent international conferences have adopted resolutions to reduce carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. Another group of climatologists bases its findings on observations of solar activity, arguing that global warming is caused by a recurring spike in solar activity, with the current increase due to end soon, potentially giving way to a new ice age down the road. In the following work, we put forth yet another hypothesis regarding global warming. The influence of four main positive feedback loops caused by the secondary emission of water vapor, ÑÎ2, ÑÎ4, and decreased albedo on the earth climate system is shown on the basis of the general theory of feedback. If the present level of primary anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gas (GhG) keeps, the total mass of atmospheric greenhouse gas can run up to such a critical value that the mentioned feedbacks, which give rise to self-amplification of the greenhouse effect, can cause the bifurcation transition of the climate system to the state of self-heating tending to the unlimited rise of mean temperature of the earth surface.В останні роки змінення клімату Землі непокоїть громадськість світу. Зростання стихійних лих, раптові температурні коливання в окремих регіонах світу та інші відхилення клімату від традиційної поведінки кліматологи пов'язують з глобальним потеплінням. Наукова громадськість з кліматології розділилася щодо питання механізму природи потепління клімату Землі. Одні дослідники вважають, що з моменту початку промислової революції виробнича діяльність людства з кожним роком збільшує кількість вуглекислого газу у повітрі. Як установлено, поряд з іншими газами він відповідає за парниковий ефект. У зв'язку з цим останнім часом відбулося кілька міжнародних конференцій, на яких ухвалено рішення про скорочення викидів вуглекислого газу в атмосферу

basic summary: These 4 loops result from secondary GhG emissions caused by the increase of mean temperature due to primary GhG emissions. Increase in secondary GhG emissions ca- used by the same primary increase in mean temperature continues to occur as the abso- lute value of the latter becomes larger. We believe that the emission of CO2 from the worlds oceans is the second loop of a feedback in the earths climate system. These gases ac- count for the second part of the mean tem- perature rise due to self-triggering of the earths climate system owing to positive fe- edbacks. Key words: greenhouse gas, positive feedback, temperature rise, bifurcation transition. Before defining feedback factors for the four positive feedback loops it is necessary to return to the problem of CO2 absorption by the worlds oceans. The third positive feedback loop is caused by secondary CH4 emission from the permafrost zones. In this way a CO2 positive feedback loop is cre- ated, with the secondary CO2 emission be- ing influenced by this decrease in absorp- tion. But this temperature rise leads to the emission of greenhouse gases from the permafrost zones, increases water evaporation and decreases the albedo. The fourth positive feedback loop results from the secondary decrease in the earths reflectivity (albedo) due to continuing re- duction in the area of ice and snow cover. 40, 2018 71 ory of feedback can be used to research the influence of feedbacks on the earths climate system. A feedback works in a system only if this system is active. In a previous work [Klimchuk, Tarasov, 2005] we singled out 4 main loops of a posi- tive feedback in the earths climate system. It is easy to show that the transmission factor (function) K fu of the system with a feedback shown by the structural scheme in Fig. Positive feedback between global warming and atmo- spheric CO2 concentration inferred from past climate change.

sim_matrix summary: We believe that the emission of CO2 from the worlds oceans is the second loop of a feedback in the earths climate system. The further incre- ase of this factor will lead to the bifurcation transition of the earths climate system in which self-triggering of the secondary GhG emissions results in a state of self-heating with the tendency for mean temperature to rise indefinitely. Therefore, in considering the earths clima- te system when the input action U1 is un- derstood as the increase of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases, we can spe- ak of positive feedbacks only when there are such responses Ufu that represent incre- ases of secondary emissions of greenhouse gases generated in the earths climate sys- tem due primarily to anthropogenic emissi- ons of greenhouse gases. Returning to the earths cli- mate system, we consider the increase of GhG emissions to be the input action for the earths climate system, and the increase of mean temperature of the earths surface to be the response. The in- fluence of four main positive feedback loops caused by the secondary emission of wa- ter vapor, CO2, CO4, and decreased albedo on the earths climate system is shown on the basis of the general theory of feedback. These 4 loops result from secondary GhG emissions caused by the increase of mean temperature due to primary GhG emissions. 40, 2018 75 regenerative self-amplification of the green- house gas emission becomes: = α− = ∂ ∂ = 0 0 0 gh gh gh 1 K K V T K , 1 ghgh 00 F K S K = − = (7) where ∂Tgh is the actual increase in mean temperature subject to the positive feedback influence caused by the increase ∂V0 in the primary effective GhG emission, Fgh is the recurrent difference of the greenhouse ef- fect. The main dif- ference from today was that the primary in- fluence on the earths climate system were variations in solar radiation, the amplifica- tion of which led to increases in mean tem- perature, which turned the worlds oceans into sources of secondary CO2 emission. If the present level of primary anthropo- genic emissions of greenhouse gas (GhG) keeps, the total mass of atmospheric green- house gas can run up to such a critical value that the mentioned feedbacks, which gi- ve rise to self-amplification of the greenhouse effect, can cause the bifurcation transiti- on of the climate system to the state of self-heating tending to the unlimited rise of me- an temperature of the earths surface. There- fore, the rise of mean temperature caused by primary GhG emissions results in the in- crease of evaporation from open reservoirs, that is, in the secondary water vapor emis- sion which in turn increases mean tempera- ture due to the accumulation of atmospheric heat energy. Based on this and taking into account (2) and (3) the positive feedback factor αgh and the reversion ratio Sgh of the greenhouse ef- fect are defined as: ,almetvarcargh α+α+α+α=α , 0 gh V V S ∂ ∂ = Σ (6) where Σ∂V  is the increase of the summed equivalent secondary GhG emission. These gases ac- count for the second part of the mean tem- perature rise due to self-triggering of the earths climate system owing to positive fe- edbacks. That is why it is inevitable in the com- ing decades when the summed secondary GhG emission equalizes the primary GhG emission, i. e., the factor of the secondary greenhouse gas emission equals amounts to the critical value Sgh = 1. 40, 2018 73 where ∂V0 is the increase of the primary GhG emission measured in carbon dioxide equivalent during the same time interval, ∂T0 is the increase of mean temperature in- duced by this emission and attributed to du- ring the same time interval. In this way a CO2 positive feedback loop is cre- ated, with the secondary CO2 emission be- ing influenced by this decrease in absorp- tion.

text_rank summary: The in- fluence of four main positive feedback loops caused by the secondary emission of wa- ter vapor, CO2, CO4, and decreased albedo on the earths climate system is shown on the basis of the general theory of feedback.Today anthropogenic CO2 emissions are having a major impact on the climate system as a result of the partial pressure of CO2 ex- ceeding the equilibrium value correspond- ing to the present mean temperature, which has led to the worlds oceans absorbing ex- cess of CO2 from the atmosphere.These gases ac- count for the second part of the mean tem- perature rise due to self-triggering of the earths climate system owing to positive fe- edbacks.Taking into account the above-mention- ed, the feedback factors for the four consi- dered positive feedback loops can be pre- sented as follows: , 0 car car T V ∂ ∂ =α  , 0 var var T V ∂ ∂ =α  , 0 met met T V ∂ ∂ =α , 0 al al T V ∂ ∂ =α (5) where ∂Vcar , ∂Vvar , ∂Vmet , ∂Val are the se- condary equivalent emissions caused by the primary increase in mean temperature ∂T0 and resulting from the secondary emission CO2, of water vapor, CH4, and the albedo decrease respectively.The main dif- ference from today was that the primary in- fluence on the earths climate system were variations in solar radiation, the amplifica- tion of which led to increases in mean tem- perature, which turned the worlds oceans into sources of secondary CO2 emission.Returning to the earths cli- mate system, we consider the increase of GhG emissions to be the input action for the earths climate system, and the increase of mean temperature of the earths surface to be the response.If the present level of primary anthropo- genic emissions of greenhouse gas (GhG) keeps, the total mass of atmospheric green- house gas can run up to such a critical value that the mentioned feedbacks, which gi- ve rise to self-amplification of the greenhouse effect, can cause the bifurcation transiti- on of the climate system to the state of self-heating tending to the unlimited rise of me- an temperature of the earths surface.We think the positive feedback loop ca- used by secondary CH4 emissions from the permafrost zones, where its storage in the form of gas-hydrates is enormous, to be the third.That is why by the increase in the prima- ry GhG emission in (3) its effective value is understood which is equal to ,car00 VVV ∂−′∂=∂ (4) where ∂V0′ is the actual increase in the pri- mary equivalent GhG emission at the fix- ed time interval, ∂Vcar is the portion of CO2 from the primary GhG emission absorbed by the World ocean at the same time interval.It means that value K0 = ∂T0 /∂V0, in (3) and (7) is the increasing time function, which increases the danger of the early occurren- ce of this state.The further incre- ase of this factor will lead to the bifurcation transition of the earths climate system in which self-triggering of the secondary GhG emissions results in a state of self-heating with the tendency for mean temperature to rise indefinitely.Consequently, in the past the earths clima- te was affected by the three ( ignoring any anthropogenic emissions at that time) men- tioned positive feedback loops leading to the regenerative self-amplification of the gre- enhouse effect.40, 2018 75 regenerative self-amplification of the green- house gas emission becomes: = α− = ∂ ∂ = 0 0 0 gh gh gh 1 K K V T K , 1 ghgh 00 F K S K = − = (7) where ∂Tgh is the actual increase in mean temperature subject to the positive feedback influence caused by the increase ∂V0 in the primary effective GhG emission, Fgh is the recurrent difference of the greenhouse ef- fect.We believe that the emission of CO2 from the worlds oceans is the second loop of a feedback in the earths climate system.However, owing to the increase in mean temperatu- re caused by anthropogenic GhG emissions, the equilibrium value of CO2 partial pres- sure corresponding to mean temperature al- so continuously increases, which is decrea- sing the oceans absorption of this gas.

Taking into account (3), the connection between the primary increase and the actu- al one in mean temperature in the presen- ce of the regenerative self-amplification of the greenhouse effect is expressed as fol- lows: , gh gh 0 0 0 FV T V T ∂ ∂ = ∂ ∂ , gh gh 0 F T T ∂ =∂ . If the signs (phases) of signals U1 and Ufu coinci- de, the signal Uin and the response U2 in- crease accordingly to feedback. It increases the mean tempera- ture of the earth. Taking into account the above-mention- ed, the feedback factors for the four consi- dered positive feedback loops can be pre- sented as follows: , 0 car car T V ∂ ∂ =α , 0 var var T V ∂ ∂ =α , 0 met met T V ∂ ∂ =α , 0 al al T V ∂ ∂ =α (5) where ∂Vcar , ∂Vvar , ∂Vmet , ∂Val are the se- condary equivalent emissions caused by the primary increase in mean temperature ∂T0 and resulting from the secondary emission CO2, of water vapor, CH4, and the albedo decrease respectively. Taking into account inestigations about impact at climate positive feedback are con- tining [Plattner et al., 2009; MacDougall et al., 2015; MacDougall, Knutti, 2016; Rug- enstein et al., 2016] we propose that rese- archers calculate estimates of the time de- pendence ∂Fgh / ∂t i. e., the rate of approach to the self-heating bifurcation and estima- te the likely time necessary for the transiti- on to this state under the condition of futu- re growth of the increase in the primary GhG emission. But they are smaller as so- me of CO2 is absorbed by the worlds oceans. In the fol- lowing work, we put forth yet another hypothesis regarding global warming. As CO2 is an essential part of GhG emissions, it is reaso- nable to express both primary and secon- dary GhG emissions in their carbon dioxi- de equivalents. The correctness of the factor αcar is de- termined by the fact that the absorption of CO2 by the World Ocean is allowed for by (4). If the output of the unit of feedback 2 is disconnected from the adder 3 and the unit action is used at the input of system 1, the response at the output of the unit of feed- back will be numerically equal to the loop gain S, which in case of multiloop feedbacks is usually called the reversion ratio. Un- der present conditions the worlds oceans are powerful inhibitors of the rate of anth- ropogenic global warming.

Title: Effect of cytostatic agents on expression levels of human beta-defensins-1-4  in A431 and MCF-7 cell lines
Word count: 1760
Abstract: The aim of the study was to analyze an effect of cytostatic agents of different mechanism of action on expression levels of human beta-defensins-1-4 (hBD-1-4) in cultured human cancer cell lines. Materials and Methods: Expression levels of hBD-1-4 mRNA were assessed using qPCR in human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells and human breast adenocarcinoma MCF7 cells treated with cisplatin, methotrexate, doxorubicin or vincristine at the IC20 concentrations. Results: The cytostatic agents with different mechanisms of action affected differently expression of hBDs, dependent on the cell line. Mostly, cytostatic agents suppressed significantly expression of hBDs. In contrast, vincristine caused significant up-regulation of hBD-1 (12 fold, p < 0.05) and hBD-4 (2 fold, p < 0.05) in MCF7, and doxorubicin significantly enhanced expression of hBD-3 (2 fold, p < 0.05) and hBD-4 (> 10 fold, p < 0.05) in A431 cells. Conclusion: The results of this pilot study show that expression levels of hBD-1-4 may be altered upon treatment with cytostatic agents depending on nature of cells

Title: Structure and physicochemical properties of antiseptics and disinfectants in relation to their activity
Word count: 3008
Abstract: Antiseptics and disinfectants represent a large group of compounds that have different effects depending on the used concentration. They are substances that remove bacteria from the skin or materials and are part of the practices for infection control in hospitals.   The action of antiseptics and disinfectants is due to mutual reaction with the cell surface of the microorganisms, followed by their penetration into the cells and the influence on a certain target area. Intrahospital (inpatient, nosocomial) infections are localized or generalized infections caused by microorganisms acquired during hospitalization. Intrahospital infections also include recurrent infections acquired during other hospitalizations and other manifest infections in patients that move from one hospital to another. In fact, these infections can result from inappropriate use of antiseptics and disinfectants. The purpose of this study is to establish a correlation between the mechanism of action of antiseptics and disinfectants and their chemical structure.   This correlation may be the basis for creating an approach that will be used as prevention from the occurrence of intrahospital or nosocomial infections. The establishment of such an approach is crucial because it is necessary to know which antiseptic or disinfectant has the greatest activity against the microorganism which is the cause of the intrahospital (nosocomial) infection. \u

basic summary: The most commonly used antiseptics and disinfectants in the researched hospitals are: ethanol (alcohols), pividone iodine (halogen release agents), formaldehyde (alde- hydes) and hydrogen peroxide (peroxides). Further free iodine is released from the povidone-iodine complex as free iodine is used up, until the available iodine is exhausted. Also, ethanol shows limited activity against chlamydiae and fungal spored, but shows no activity against: non-enveloped viruses, bac- terial spored, coccidia and prions . 2.2 Povidone iodine Povidone iodine is a stable chemical complex of poly- vinylpyrrolidone (povidone, PVP) and elemental io- dine. 2.1 Ethanol solution The ethanol solution used as antiseptic and disinfec- tant contains ethanol in water in different concentra- tions. Chemical structure of povidone iodine The molecular formula of this chemical complex is C 6 H 9 I 2 NO. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a correlation between the chemical structure and the activity of antiseptics and disinfectants. The free iodine concentration has been shown to increase with more dilute concentrations of povidone-iodine, with a maxi- mal free iodine concentration of 24 parts per million at 0.7%. The purpose of this study is to establish a correlation between the mechanism of action of antiseptics and disinfectants and their chem- ical structure. It has limited activity against: non-enveloped viruses, fungal spores, acid-fast bacteria and no activity against coccidia and prions .

sim_matrix summary: Therefore,  it is necessary to establish a correlation between the  chemical structure and the activity of antiseptics and  disinfectants. To be classified as  an infection, the condition must be manifested as a  clinical disease and not a colonization, which means  that microorganisms are present but have no adverse  effect on the host. 4,  pp. It is very important to use the right  antiseptics for the treatment of certain infections and  the right disinfectants for removal the microorganisms  from the medical equipment used in diagnostics and  surgery. This statement represents the correlation  between the mechanism of action and the structure  of ethanol. Oxidised molecules are more sensitive to proteolysis  than other molecules, and it has been suggested that a  ‘system of cell senitisation’ may enter into effect under  the action of an oxidising agent such as H 2 O 2  [6]. When the concentration of the ethanol is  70%, the solution causes gradual coagulation, slowing  down the microorganism from the inside out while  penetrating. However, there is also a  correlation between the concentration and the activity  of the antiseptics and disinfectants. The most  commonly used antiseptics and disinfectants in the  researched hospitals are: ethanol (alcohols), pividone  iodine (halogen release agents), formaldehyde (alde- hydes) and hydrogen peroxide (peroxides). Structure and physicochemical properties  of selected antiseptics and disinfectants in  relation to their activity  The following is a review of the literature on a top- ic which has been continuously evolving.

text_rank summary: The general mechanism of action at the cellular level  can be explained by the ability of the hydrogen perox- ide to induce DNA damage that appears to involve a  role for transition metal ions bound to DNA, which may  interact with H 2 O 2  resulting in the production of a reac- tive radical species, most likely OH.In vivo, known inhib- itors of povidone–iodine (blood, pus, fat, glove powder  as well as protein containing solutions) may be present  and may have a role of altering bactericidal efficacy, or  the dose or volume of the povidone–iodine may vary  depending on the contact time and retention within  the conjunctival fornix [8].This conclusion is  based on the fact that ethanol causes coagulation of  proteins on contact and accordingly the 100% ethanol  when comes into contact with a microorganism cre- ates hardened protein wall around the outside of the  microorganism, rather than permating into its interior.The action of antiseptics and disinfectants is due to  mutual reaction with the cell surface of the microor- ganisms, followed by their penetration into the cells  and the influence on a certain target area.Journal of Hygienic Engineering and Design 7 A correlation between the mechanism of action and  the concentration of hydrogen peroxide can also be  established.Hydrogen peroxide in the home is in dil- luted form (3 - 10%) whereas industrial use involves  concentrated solutions (30% or greater).The general mechanism of action of formaldehyde lies  in its ability to produce insoluble complex compounds  with proteins.Because biocides range in antimicrobial activity,  other terms may be more specific, including “-static”,  referring to agents that inhibit growth (e.g.Oxidised molecules are more sensitive to proteolysis  than other molecules, and it has been suggested that a  ‘system of cell senitisation’ may enter into effect under  the action of an oxidising agent such as H 2 O 2  [6].They carried out tests in vitro to demonstrate  anti–bacterial activity, and found that the complex was  less toxic in mice than tincture of iodine.

Title: Sustainability of the textile waste stream in Macedonia,
Word count: 3517
Abstract: In Macedonia, as a country with a developed apparel industry, a significant amount of pre-consumer textile waste is generated, more precisely apparel cutting waste. The aim of this paper is to make an accurate estimate of its quantity, as well as the characterization based on the raw material composition as a prerequisite for its further handling. Before any recycling initiative for textile waste, an analysis should be made of whether its quantity and quality can ensure the continuity of the recycling process. The analysis shows that the amount of apparel cutting waste is a fairly constant value (in the period from 2009 to 2014 an average of 3,377 tons of apparel cutting waste was generated annually). The waste from cotton and cotton blends is most common. Despite the constant annual amount of apparel cutting waste and numerous reasons for its recycling, almost all this waste ends in landfills

Title: Acupuncture treatment in regulation of hyperprolactinemia
Word count: 947
Abstract: Hyperprolactinemia is a disorder of the endocrine system that causes the body to produce higher levels of prolactin than normal. Prolactin hormone stimulates the production of breast milk during pregnancy and is inducing the lactation after giving birth. In absence of pregnancyif the prolactin levels are high, it may lead to infertility. Acupuncture as part of the Traditional Chinese Medicine treats hormonal imbalances very often. Acupuncture can regulate and rapidly normalize the prolactin levels. The treated patient is an 18 year old girl with high levels of prolactin - 49 ng/mL (normal range – 4.50-33.0 ng/mL). The menstruation was also delayed for several days. The patient was treated with acupuncture with duration of 35-40 minutes one side of the body. 9 treatments were made once weekly in a period of 3 months. After the 9th treatment the results from the blood test came normal and the prolactin level was normalized – 22.1 ng/mL.Acupuncture as a treatment for hyperprolactinemia can be a very successful treatment by improving the hormone levels, harmonizing the menstrual and ovulation function and the overall reproductive health

Title: Understanding “Democratization of the higher education” for an efficient university development strategy
Word count: 1587
Abstract: Understanding the term «DEMOCRATIZATION» today is rather uncertain and each speaker understands different shades of its possible meanings. The democratization of  education in turn is a concept even less well-understood therefore it seems to be important to clarify the difference between liberalization, destandartization, restructurization and democratization processes in education. Having studied the verbalization of the «DEMOCRATIZATION» concept and its «DEMOCRATIZATION of EDUCATION» microconcept, we have identified certain features encoded in this concept in order to ease roadmapping for those educators who want to democratize education in Ukrain

Title: AutoRE (Automotive Derivative Energy System). 2 Years in
Word count: 878
Abstract: AutoRE is a multi- partner project funded under the FCH-JU FCH-02.5-2014 call, aimed at demonstrating an automotive derivative fuel cell integrated with a natural gas reformer to make the required high purity hydrogen. The system prototype, to be demonstrated at GE’s Rugby site in the UK, has a targeted electrical efficiency of 38-40%, with parallel component developments, such as hydrogen separation membranes, undertaken to increase the efficiency of a subsequent commercial system to >45%. The market for the product will be 50-100kWe applications in industrial and commercial buildings in combined heat and power (CHP) mode. At this scale, the fuel cell based CHP system has potential cost of electricity and emissions advantage over competing technologies. The project is now in its third year, with the build of the prototype system significantly underway. This paper gives the status of the project as reported at the mid-term meeting.This project has received funding from the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking under grant agreement No 671396. This Joint Undertaking receives support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme and UK, Germany, Greece, Croatia, Italy, Switzerland, Norway. Swiss partners are funded by the State Secretariat for Education, Research & Innovation of the Swiss Confederation

The market for the product will be 50-100kWe applications in industrial and commercial buildings in combined heat and power (CHP) mode. The decline in performance was attributed to CO poising, where CO is formed following the reverse water gas shift reaction. Increasing the proportion of CO2 reduced the performance of the fuel cell, although this performance was fully recovered when pure hydrogen fuel was re-introduced.

Title: A peek at the nano-level to biomimic bones
Word count: 599
Abstract: From the pattern of a honeycomb to the complexity of a DNA strand -- the intricate structures found in nature have astounded and inspired many scientists and designers for centuries. Many newer and better technologies in the fields of medicine and research, like the bullet trains in Japan inspired by the kingfisher's beak, or the prosthetic arm inspired by tentacles, were possible, thanks to nature. Now, a study by researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Hyderabad, aims to study the structure and composition of human bones to help in repairing them

basic summary: An alternative to this is to 'manufacture' bone tissue artificially that is similar to natural bone tissue in porosity and composition. When the researchers tested this substrate, they found that the stem cells developed into different cells that make up the bone tissue. In the world of medicine, the technique most commonly used to repair bone tissue is called a bone graft.

Title: Diversification in Recommendation System
Word count: 2859
Abstract: Diversification in Recommendation system However, if it shows many similar items that might become monotonous for the user To handle this scenario is to diversify the recommended list. Di- versification helps in recommendation without data(cold start problem) .Diversification maintain the trade off between popularity, freshness and relevance items. In real time Diversification helps in better coverage of items in the recommendation list. It can give emphasis to both novelty and relevance. Novelty means items that contain new information when compared to previously seen ones and covers all the topics. Relevance include top ranked item of the search results
basic similarity: 0.6179526325338623
basic summary: After comparing with other items recommendation system will recommend the best matching items to the user such as what movies to watch. 12 Chapter 6 Conclusion Diversification helps in better coverage of recommendation list.Diversification minimize the query abandonment means user will find at least one relevant document in the recommendation list. Similarity of items is determined by the similarity of the ratings of those items by the users who have rated both items. Figure 1.1: Application of recommendation systems 1 Chapter 2 Motivation Diversification helps in better coverage of items in the recommendation list. Suppose 10 items are recommended to the user out of which only 4 items are liked by the user then precision will be 0.4 . Novelty helps in recommending items that contain new information when compared to previously seen ones and covers all the topics in the recommendation list.

Title: Optimum power allocation for uniform illuminance in indoor visible light communication
Word count: 3169
Abstract: In this paper an optimal power allocation scheme is proposed to acheive uniform illuminance. Regular arrays and random geometries are considered for an arrangement of the source LEDs. Uniform illuminance is accomplished by considering the variance of the received power on the receiver plane as metric and framing it as a convex optimization problem. Numerical results show that the quality factor of random geometries are superior to fixed geometries. While preserving uniformity, the cost of the system can be reduced when random geometries are used. © 2018 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreemen

basic summary: Optimal distribution of total transmit power across source LEDs and their SNR profiles. In , the light sources are modeled using stochastic geometry by locating them randomly in an indoor environment, generating average uniform illumination with appropriate power allocation. Uniform illuminance is accomplished by considering the variance of the received power on the receiver plane as metric and framing it as a convex optimization problem. The variance and quality factor for different power allocation in different geometries have been tabulated in 3 and 4. a powerful tool for resource allocation for VLC , it is useful to consider power allocation for a VLC based on a single realization of a stochastic point process. Uniform illuminance can also be obtained by appropriate allocation of power to an arrangement of the source LEDs.

sim_matrix summary: Since the SNR at the receiver is proportional to square of received power (or received power) in low transmit power regime (or high transmit power), the power allocation for uniform illuminance also results in uniform SNR. Uniform illuminance can also be obtained by appropriate allocation of power to an arrangement of the source LEDs. 7 | 2 Apr 2018 | OPTICS EXPRESS 8686  0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025 0.03 0.035 0.04 0.045 0 5 10 15 Transmit power threshold F Λ     0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 N um be r o f L ED s Quality factor FΛ Number of LEDs Fig. 6 the quality factor and number of source LEDs are plotted with respect to the transmit power threshold. 7 | 2 Apr 2018 | OPTICS EXPRESS 8685  (a) HCPP with intensity λmpp=32 and threshold 0.0027 (b) HCPP with intensity λmpp=200 and threshold 0.017 −2 −1 0 1 2 −2 −1 0 1 2 10 15 20 25 (c) SNR profile of the above realization with 16 LEDs resulting in quality factor FΛ = 6.29 −2 −1 0 1 2 −2 −1 0 1 2 10 15 20 25 (d) SNR profile of the above realization with 16 LEDs resulting in quality factor FΛ = 11.35 Fig. 4 the optimal allocation of total transmit power P = 2W across 16 source LEDs distributed according to HCPP is shown.

text_rank summary: Since the photo detectors can be located at any point in the plane, the variance of the received power is considered as a objective function to be minimized min Pti E [( Prj − E [ Prj ] )2] (5) This can be formulated as an optimization problem.Here, a Matern type II hard-core point process (HCPP) is desirable and more appropriate, since it accounts for minimum separation between any two LEDs for better coverage and reduced interference between adjacent LEDs.Through numerical results, it is shown that this approach is superior to existing techniques for power allocation and also reduces the cost of the system in terms of the number of LEDs.A.

Title: Exploring caregivers’ experiences of caring for men with advanced prostate cancer in a resource-poor setting: a qualitative serial interview study
Word count: 911
Abstract: Background: Family caregivers who assume the responsibility of care for patients living with advanced diseases could have challenges especially in resource-poor settings. The bulk and responsibility for care are predominantly provided by the family caregivers within the informal sector. The family caregivers, therefore, could be described as the ‘general practitioners’ of the patients at home. Using a qualitative study, the experiences of the family caregivers caring for men with advanced prostate cancer were explored.  Methods: Using serial qualitative approach, 23 in-depth individual and dyad interviews were conducted. Patients and their caregivers participated in repeat interviews approximately 2 months apart, across a period of up to 6 months. Transcribed interviews were analysed using thematic analysis.  Findings: This paper focuses on the experiences of family caregivers in the light of inadequate resources for care. Two main themes emerged from the data: Challenges and burden of care, and the support and coping strategies adopted. The family caregivers expressed the overburden nature of the care, ‘feeling of being alone in the middle of a deep sea’, disruption of their lives, and unhappiness and the fear of an unknown future. On the other hand, they rely on the support of the social network of the extended family, their faith in God, and the positive aspect of living helped to mitigate some of the challenges. The belief in reciprocity and ‘giving back’ through caring for their loved ones were highlighted by participants.  Conclusion: Generally, the informal social network helped in the care at home. However, the magnitude of the adverse changes in their lives and challenges associated with the caring role was dependent on factors such as the level of care required, financial and other resources available, and the coping mechanisms in place. Efforts to enhance existing social support systems are recommended

Title: Thermodynamic Properties of Kehagias-Sfetsos Black Hole \& KS/CFT  Correspondence
Word count: 2953
Abstract: We speculate on various thermodynamic features of the innerhorizon~(${\mathcal H}^{-}$) and outer horizons~(${\mathcal H}^{+}$) ofKehagias-Sfetsos~(KS) black hole~(BH) in the background of Ho\v{r}ava Lifshitzgravity. We compute particularly the \emph{area product, area sum, area minusand area division} of the BH horizons. We find that they all are \emph{not}showing universal behavior whereas the product is a universal quantity~[Pradhan P., \textit{Phys. Lett. B}, {\bf 747} (2015) {64}]. Based on theserelations, we derive the area bound of all horizons. From the area bound wederive the entropy bound and irreducible mass bound for all thehorizons~(${\mathcal H}^{\pm}$). We also observe that the \emph{First law} ofBH thermodynamics and \emph {Smarr-Gibbs-Duhem } relations do not hold for thisBH. The underlying reason behind this failure due to the scale invariance ofthe coupling constant. Moreover, we compute the\emph{Cosmic-Censorship-Inequality} for this BH which gives the lower bound forthe total mass of the spacetime and it is supported by cosmic cencorshipconjecture. Finally, we discuss the KS/CFT~(Conformal Field Theory)correspondence via a thermodynamic procedure.Comment: Version accepted in EP

basic summary: Based on these relations, we computed area bound, entropy bound, irreducible mass bound, temperature bound and specific heat bound. It is also interesting to mentioned that except the area product, entropy product and irreducible mass product all the thermodynamic relations of KS BH are mass dependent. We speculated that area sum, area minus and area division are mass dependent quantities, whereas the product is a mass independent quantity. In our previous study , we derived the surface area product, BH entropy product, surface temperature product, Komar energy product and specific heat product for this BH. Besides the area or entropy product it should be known what happens in case of area sum, area minus and area division. (13) It is remarkable that the area product of KS BH is independent of mass but the area sum is not independent of the mass parameter. From area bound we derive entropy bound and irreducible mass bound for all the horizons (H±). From area bound we derive entropy bound and irreducible mass bound for both the horizons. Likewise, the entropy product and entropy sum of H± becomes: S−S+ = pi 2 4ω2 and S− + S+ = pi ( 4M2 − 1 ω ) . For this reason we extend our study by computing area sum, entropy sum, temperature sum and specific heat sum of all the horizons. We compute particularly area sum, area minus and area division of the BH horizons.

(39) and the entropy sum gives: pi ( 4M2 − 1 ω ) = S+ + S− ≥ S+ ≥ S+ + S− 2 = pi ( 2M2 − 1 2ω ) . Likewise, the entropy product [7] and entropy sum of H± becomes: S−S+ = pi 2 4ω2 and S− + S+ = pi ( 4M2 − 1 ω ) . (15) Again, the sum of area inverse is found to be 1 A+ + 1 A− = ω2 pi ( 4M2 − 1 ω ) . But for KS BH this relation is M 2 − T±S± − Φω± 2 ω = 2 + 5ωr2± 8ωr±(1 + ωr2±) 6= 0. (20) Again, the sum of entropy inverse is found to be 1 S+ + 1 S− = 4ω2 pi ( 4M2 − 1 ω ) . (11) The area[7] of this BH is given by A± = 4pi ( 2Mr± − 1 2ω ) (12) Their product[7] and sum yields A+A− = 4pi 2 ω2 and A+ +A− = 4pi ( 4M2 − 1 ω ) . (35) 5 and the area sum gives: 4pi ( 4M2 − 1 ω ) = A+ +A− ≥ A+ ≥ A+ +A− 2 = 2pi ( 4M2 − 1 ω ) . It is shown that for KS BH: T+S+ + T−S− = 8ωM √ M2 − 1 2ω 1 + 16ωM2 . (16) and the minus of area inverse is computed to be 1 A± − 1A∓ = ∓4ω 2M pi √ M2 − 1 2ω . The product and sum of horizon radii becomes r+r− = 1 2ω and r+ + r− = 2M .

(26) It is in-fact a mass independent (universal) relation and implies that T+S+ = T−S− should be taken as a criterion whether there is a 2D CFT dual for the BHs in the Einstein gravity and other diffeomorphism gravity theories [11, 32]. We computed various thermodynamic formula for this BH. As long as M2 − 1 2ω ≥ 0 . (10) then the KS metric describes a BH, otherwise it has a naked singularity. 01 18 6v 2 [g r-q c] 13 O ct 20 16 Area (or Entropy) Bound of Horizons for Horˇava Lifshitz Black Hole Parthapratim Pradhan∗ Department of Physics, Vivekananda Satabarshiki Mahavidyalaya, West Midnapur 721513, India Abstract We speculate various thermodynamic features of the inner horizon (H−) and outer horizon (H+) in the background of Horˇava Lifshitz black hole (BH).

Title: The precision of parameter estimation for dephasing model under squeezed  reservoir
Word count: 3453
Abstract: We study the precision of parameter estimation for dephasing model undersqueezed environment. We analytically calculate the dephasing factor$\gamma(t)$ and obtain the analytic quantum Fisher information (QFI) for theamplitude parameter $\alpha$ and the phase parameter $\phi$. It is shown thatthe QFI for the amplitude parameter $\alpha$ is invariant in the whole process,while the QFI for the phase parameter $\phi$ strongly depends on the reservoirsqueezing. It is shown that the QFI can be enhanced for appropriate squeezeparameters $r$ and $\theta$. Finally, we also investigate the effect oftemperature on the QFI

basic summary: This shows that the squeeze phase parameter θ plays more significant role than the squeeze parameter r in this parameter estimation scheme. The environment ρbath is assumed to be the squeezed vacuum reservoir, which is given by ρbath = ∏ k Sk (r, θ) |0k〉 〈0k|Sk (r, θ) † . The competition between the squeeze parameter r and the squeeze phase parameter θ determines whether the QFI is enhanced or descended in the dephasing process. In this paper, we investigate the effects of reservoir squeez- ing on the estimation precision of the amplitude parameter α ∗Electronic address: quaninformation@sina.com and the phase parameter φ. We analytically calculate the dephasing factor γ(t) and obtain the analytic quantum Fisher information (QFI) for the amplitude parameter α and the phase parameter φ.

Title: A note on the Borwein conjecture
Word count: 2026
Abstract: A conjecture of Borwein asserts that for any positive integer $n$ and $k$,the coefficient $a_{3k}$ of $q^{3k}$ in the expansion of $\prod_{j=0}^n(1-q^{3j+1})(1-q^{3j+2})$ is nonnegative.  In this paper we prove that for any $0 \leq k\leq n$, there is a constant$0<c<1$ such that $a_{3k}+a_{3(n+1)+3k}+\cdots+a_{3n(n+1)+3k}=\frac {2\cdot3^{N/3}} {N}(1+O(c^N)).$  In particular, $a_{3k}+a_{3(n+1)+3k}+\cdots+a_{3n(n+1)+3k}>0.$Comment: 12 pages; proofs simplified and a bit more strong result adde

Title: Trajectory-based interpretation of laser light diffraction by a sharp  edge
Word count: 1351
Abstract: In the diffraction pattern produced by a half-plane sharp edge when itobstructs the passage of a laser beam, two characteristic regions arenoticeable. There is a central region, where it can be noticed the diffractionof laser light in the region of geometric shadow, while intensity oscillationsare observed in the non-obstructed area. On both sides of the edge, there arealso very long light traces along the normal to the edge of the obstacle. Thetheoretical explanation to this phenomenon is based on the Fresnel-Kirchhoffdiffraction theory applied to the Gaussian beam propagation behind theobstacle. Here we have supplemented this explanation by consideringelectromagnetic flow lines, which provide a more complete interpretation of thephenomenon in terms of electric and magnetic fields and flux lines, and thatcan be related, at the same time, with average photon paths.Comment: 13 pages, 5 figure

Abstract: We give a negative answer to the Newman--Shapiro problem on weightedapproximation for entire functions formulated in 1966 and motivated by thetheory of operators on the Fock space. There exists a function in the Fockspace such that its exponential multiples do not approximate some entiremultiples in the space. Furthermore, we establish several positive resultsunder different restrictions on the function in question.Comment: 28 page

Title: Coupling magneto-elastic Lagrangians to spin transfer torque sources
Word count: 3769
Abstract: The consequences of coupling magnetic and elastic degrees of freedom, wherespins and deformations are carried by point-like objects subject to localinteractions, are studied, theoretically and by detailed numerical simulations.From the constrained Lagrangians we derive consistent equations of motion forthe coupled dynamical variables. In order to probe the dynamics of such asystem, we consider external perturbations, such as spin transfer torques forthe magnetic part, and homogeneous stresses for the elastic part, associated totheir corresponding damping. This approach is applied to the study of ultrafastswitching processes in anti-ferromagnetic systems, which have recentlyattracted attention as candidates for anti-ferromagnetic spintronic devices.Our strategy is then checked in simple, but instructive, situations. We carriedout numerical experiments to study, in particular, how the magnetostrictivecoupling and external stresses affect the nature of the switching processes ina prototype anti-ferromagnetic material.Comment: 6 pages, LaTeX2e, 3 figures.

Title: Stabilization of the Peregrine soliton and Kuznetsov-Ma breathers by  means of nonlinearity and dispersion management
Word count: 3344
Abstract: We demonstrate a possibility to make rogue waves (RWs) in the form of thePeregrine soliton (PS) and Kuznetsov-Ma breathers (KMBs) effectively stableobjects, with the help of properly defined dispersion or nonlinearitymanagement applied to the continuous-wave (CW) background supporting the RWs.In particular, it is found that either management scheme, if applied along thelongitudinal coordinate, making the underlying nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation(NLSE) selfdefocusing in the course of disappearance of the PS, indeedstabilizes the global solution with respect to the modulational instability ofthe background. In the process, additional excitations are generated, namely,dispersive shock waves and, in some cases, also a pair of slowly separatingdark solitons. Further, the nonlinearity-management format, which makes theNLSE defocusing outside of a finite domain in the transverse direction, enablesthe stabilization of the KMBs, in the form of confined oscillating states. Onthe other hand, a nonlinearity-management format applied periodically along thepropagation direction, creates expanding patterns featuring multiplication ofKMBs through their cascading fission.Comment: Physics Letters A, on pres

Title: Determining the nature of white dwarfs from low-frequency gravitational  waves
Word count: 2458
Abstract: An extreme-mass-ratio system composed of a white dwarf (WD) and a massiveblack hole can be observed by the low-frequency gravitational wave detectors,such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). When the mass of theblack hole is around $10^4 \sim 10^5 M_\odot$, the WD will be disrupted by thetidal interaction at the final inspiraling stage. The event position and timeof the tidal disruption of the WD can be accurately determined by thegravitational wave signals. Such position and time depend upon the mass of theblack hole and especially on the density of the WD. We present the theory byusing LISA-like gravitational wave detectors, the mass-radius relation and thenthe equations of state of WDs could be strictly constrained (accuracy up to$0.1\%$). We also point out that LISA can accurately predict the disruptiontime of a WD, and forecast the electromagnetic follow-up of this tidaldisruption event.Comment: 7 pages, 2 figure

basic summary: Such position and time are determined by the mass and radius of WD and the mass of black hole. We find that the tidal radius is independent of the spin of the black hole (BH), but relates with the density of WD and mass of BH. The shadows with different color represent the range of mass and radius of compact object with a tidal disruption event seen by LISA. The measurement uncertainties of the masses of WD and black hole will also contribute to the measurement error of tidal disruption position. For a typical WD (µ = 2), we find that LISA can observe the tidal disruption of a small mass white dwarf (. When the mass of black hole is around 104 ∼ 105M , the WD will be disrupted by the tidal interaction at the final inspiralling stage.

Title: Strict n-categories and augmented directed complexes model homotopy  types
Word count: 1893
Abstract: In this paper we show that both the homotopy category of strict$n$-categories, $1\leqslant n \leqslant \infty$, and the homotopy category ofSteiner's augmented directed complexes are equivalent to the category ofhomotopy types. In order to do so, we first prove an abstract result, based ona strategy of Fritsch and Latch, giving sufficient conditions for a nervefunctor with values in simplicial sets to induce an equivalence at the level ofhomotopy categories. We then apply this result to strict $n$-categories andaugmented directed complexes, for which the hypothesis of our theorem wereestablished by Ara and Maltsiniotis

We call weak equivalences of Cda the morphisms whose image by N is a weak equivalence of ∆̂.

Title: Microwave pretreatment for the extraction of active compounds from olive pomace. Extraction optimization and dielectric properties
Word count: 408
Abstract: Producción CientíficaOlive pomace is a waste of the olive industry, with little use as a by-product. However, its high content in active compounds, like oleocanthal, hydroxytyrosol or oleuropein, makes this material a source of valuable bioactive extracts in food and health industry. Some of these compounds are highly bounded to the biomass structure, what entails the use of severe hydrothermal conditions (for instance, 180ºC for 90 minutes) or non-edible solvents (such as benzene and hexane). Accordingly, conventional solid-liquid extraction of polyphenols from olive pomace presents yet severe drawbacks to overcome. A short and intense microwave pretreatment is presented in this work as a greener effective resolution to enhance yield, final product quality and throughput capacity. Two pretreatments have been tested: an atmospheric-microwave one, which provided enough energy to reach the solvent boiling point, and a pressurized-microwave pretreatment, where a pressure of 3 bars was reached. Both pretreatments were followed by a conventional solid-liquid extraction that was also used by itself as a reference to assess the efficiency changes associated to the pretreatments. Although extraction yield (mgGAE/gDry pomace) is not highly enhanced with the addition of the pretreatments, extraction richness is. Extraction richness (mgGAE/gDry Extract) is understood as the proportion of active compounds in the possible commercial final product. This is usually a solid product, since de solvent must be removed from the extract to obtain a stable dry product. A 47% and a 39% richer extracts are obtained with the pressurized and atmpspheric microwave pretreatments, respectively. It is also noteworthy the high proportion of hydroxytyrosol obtained when pretreatments are used. The implementation of the pretreatment provides an improvement in the extraction of this compound, since a 3-fold richer extract in this compound is attained. This enhancement is also found in the antioxidant capacity of the extract, which is around 30% higher in the pretreated process than in the standalone conventional solid-liquid extraction. Such enhancements support the scale-up of the process. To achieve this goal, the dielectric properties of the complex mixture water-ethanol-pomace have been measured under microwave heating as a function of temperature. Data has also been correlated to a model able to predict multiphase mixture permittivity. The resulting model is able to estimate the dielectric constant with an accuracy of 12%, and the loss factor with a deviation of 36%. These preliminary results will be used in the near future to adapt and operate a continuous microwave extraction oven to explore the possibilities of its utilization in a real processing plant

Title: Electromagnetic Field Enhancement on Axially Heterostructured NWs: The Role of the Heterojunctions
Word count: 2254
Abstract: Semiconductor nanowires are the building blocks of future nanoelectronic devices. The study of the interaction between nanowires and visible light reveals resonances that promise light absorption/scattering engineering for photonic applications. We carried out experimental measurements through the micro-Raman spectroscopy of different group IV nanowires, both homogeneous Si nanowires and axially heterostructured SiGe/Si nanowires. These experimental measurements show an enhancement of the Raman signal in the vicinity of the heterojunction of SiGe/Si nanowires. The results are analysed in terms of the electromagnetic modelling of the light/nanowire interaction using finite element methods. The presence of axial heterostructures is shown to produce electromagnetic resonances, and the results are understood as a consequence of a finite change in the relative permittivity of the material atthe SiGe/Si heterojunction. This effect opens a path to controlling interactions between light and matter at the nanoscale with direct applications in photonic nanodevices.Junta de Castilla y Leo´n (Projects VA293U13, and VA081U16), and Spanish Government (CICYT MAT2010-20441-C02 (01 and 02)).

text_rank summary: As a result, l-Raman spectroscopy is a very suitable tool to detect the EM field distribution induced inside heterostructured NWs by an incident laser beam.For this, micro-Raman (l-R) spec- troscopy is used as a local probe of the EM field.Then, by integrating |E|2 over the different regions of the heterostructured NW for each position of the laser beam, one can calculate the theoretical Raman profile along the NW axis for comparison with the experimental profile.The EM field distribution is compared with that of a homogeneous Si NW, where there is no change in the relative permittivity, e. According to this, the EM field distribution inside the Si NW resembles the Gaussian distribution of the incident laser beam.For further details about NW growth see.5,6 Prior to the Raman measurements, the dimen- sions and morphological features of each NW were studied in a high resolution field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), Fig.Since the Raman signal is proportional to the excitation light intensity, i.e.Therefore, the Raman signal that origi- nates at the HJ is enhanced by a factor of at least 10 times with respect to a homogeneous NW of the same diameter.In this situa- tion, the value of the square of the electric field modulus |E|2 will be proportional to the local light intensity; as a consequence it will be proportional to the locally generated Raman signal.

Therefore, the Raman signal that origi- nates at the HJ is enhanced by a factor of at least 10 times with respect to a homogeneous NW of the same diameter. We can conclude that the model accounts for the experimentally observed Raman enhancement and provides an accurate framework for understanding the physics of the light/heterostructured NW interaction.

frequency summary: The EM field distribution is compared with that of a homogeneous Si NW, where there is no change in the relative permittivity, e. According to this, the EM field distribution inside the Si NW resembles the Gaussian distribution of the incident laser beam. The transition region between Si and SiGe is not an abrupt transition but a gradual change from the material composition of the SiGe segment ( 60% Ge) to the pure Si segment as a consequence of the reservoir effect of the catalyst droplet.5,7 According to the reservoir effect, the HJ extension ranges in the order of magnitude of the NW diameter, so it can be estimated to be around 50 nm or less. The enhancement effect in these NWs with a greater Ge composition ( 60% Ge) is more intense than that observed in NWs with lower Ge composition.8 Moreover, due to the higher Ge composition of the NWs, the Raman bands are clearly separated and there is no need for a deconvolution of the Raman spectra. Figure 3 shows the EM field distribution inside the heterostructured NW com- puted when the laser beam was centred on the HJ region. For example, during the growth of a SiGe segment the Ge flux was switched-off, then the pure Si segment started to grow forming the SiGe/Si heterojunction (HJ), called trailing HJ; the leading HJ was formed by switching-on the Ge flux. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS The longitudinal scans along several heterostruc- tured NWs show a clear enhancement of the Raman signal at the HJ region, see Fig. The presence of a discon- tinuity on the relative permittivity in the heterostructured NW induces the enhancement of the incident field near the HJ region as com- pared to the homogeneous NWs. CONCLUSIONS Heterostructured Si/SiGe NWs present an enhancement of the EM field at the HJ transition region.

Title: Metadata: the political dimension
Word count: 3695
Abstract: The use and management of metadata raises many ethical and eventually political issues. The security revelations by Edward Snowden in 2014 demonstrate the key role that metadata plays in surveillance. Privacy has become a particularly hot topic in recent months and much of the debate has centred on the misuse of metadata from social media and the potentially invasive effect this has on individuals. Metadata also has a key role in delivering reliable sources of information, although this has to go hand in hand with user education and improved information literacy. Access to information is a fundamental right and the appropriate use of metadata can help improve access to health, agriculture and education as well as contributing to economic development. Metadata is a route to good governance, but it must also be handled appropriately to maintain information privacy, a fundamental human right

Not only does it mean greater emphasis on teaching information literacy skills, it also means ensuring the quality of the metadata associated with information resources which will make the information accessible to the users. This information about the quality and reliability of data is another example of metadata. I would now like to consider ways in which metadata plays a role in information governance. Metadata is here for good or ill – as citizens and information users, we need to be vigilant about what data is out there, how it is managed and what controls are in place to ensure good governance.

Title: Empire and Scholarly Communications. Multinational Monopolies of Knowledge and the Global South
Word count: 457
Abstract: Poster presented at The 22nd International Conference on Electronic Publishing, Toronto, Canada, Saturday, June 23 2018. Publicly-funded knowledge is, indeed, a common good, and at odds with the all-encompassing for-profit ambitions of information and analytics conglomerates. We argue that universities, researchers and scholarly publishers in the Global South, and from all over the world, also have a responsibility to think critically about the interests of for-profit third-parties. It is crucial that researchers, as key participants and stakeholders in scholarly communications, retain control over how their research is conducted and disseminated

Title: Dark matter in quantum gravity
Word count: 2438
Abstract: We show that quantum gravity, whatever its ultra-violet completion might be, could account for dark matter. Indeed, besides the massless gravitational field recently observed in the form of gravitational waves, the spectrum of quantum gravity contains two massive fields respectively of spin 2 and spin 0. If these fields are long-lived, they could easily account for dark matter. In that case, dark matter would be very light and only gravitationally coupled to the standard model particles
basic similarity: 0.43849983727796904
basic summary: Clearly such light dark matter candidates could not decay to the massive gauge bosons of the standard model, its charged leptons such as the electron or the quarks. While we have established that quantum gravity provides two new candidates for dark matter, it remains to investigate their production mechanism. C (2018) 78:520 ρDM = 1.17 keV/cm3 if the dark matter field takes large values in the early universe. Note, however, that decay widths of the dark matter candidates to photons are smaller than the respective gravitational ones.

sim_matrix summary: C   (2018) 78:520  ρDM = 1.17 keV/cm3 if the dark matter field takes large values in the early universe. In the case of a decay to the Higgs boson, the partial decay width is given by  (k → hh) = M 3 2 430π M2P (1 − 4rh)5/2 , (18) where rh = m2h/M22 . For example, a dark matter field with a mass in the eV region would need to take values of the order of 1011 GeV to account for all of the dark matter in today’s universe [24]. If the massive spin-0 and spin-2 fields are components of the dark matter content of the universe nowadays, their masses have to be such that none of these partial decay widths should enable these fields to decay faster than the current age of the universe.

Title: Novel Kerr-Vernier effects within the on-chip Si-ChG microring circuits
Word count: 2558
Abstract: We propose a new concept of the nonlinear effect called the Kerr-Vernier effect by using cascaded Si-ChG microring circuits. The circuit is simulated for two materials of different refractive indices which results in phase difference in propagating light and hence observed in the output signal. By varying the input power into the system, the Vernier effects in terms of the Kerr-Vernier effects are seen. In application, the comparative results of the two-channel outputs are used to form the phase sensors, while the self-calibration between the two-channel outputs can be performed. The change in wavelength at the whispering gallery mode of 8 nm is achieved when the applied input power was fixed at 10 mW. A sensitivity of ∼120 µm W-1is obtained for this proposed sensor
basic similarity: 0.7467593424537613
basic summary: By varying the input power, nonlinear refractive index of the ring material with diﬀerent lengths causes changes in the propagation of light and hence in output signals. The output intensity of the proposed single system is given by the transfer function of the output power (intensities) at through port and drop port given by Eqs. The circuit is simulated for two materials of diﬀerent refractive indices which results in phase diﬀerence in propagating light and hence observed in the output signal. The shift in wavelength (or frequency) between the throughput ports of the systems introduce diﬀerent phase changes due to the refractive index changes and produce two-channel comparative results. A fraction of this power is coupled into the device that propagates throughout the ﬁrst system and the output is obtained at the throughput port. The comparison of the two outputs has shown that a phase shift of ∼120 µm −W 1 is obtained with an applied input power was ﬁxed at 10mW.

Abstract: Rapid development of music research lead into many interdisciplinary topics. These studies evoke music’s integration to many subjects, such as neuroscience. In neuroscience, music is being studied related to either its effect on cognitive process or cognitive process behind it. Previous researches suggested the difference between musicians and nonmusicians in terms of brain structure and brain activity. Instead of differentiate brain activity between musician and nonmusician, this present study aims to explain the different brain activity between two musical listeners regarding to their musical experience. Using EEG technique in experimental approach toward Piano students and Karawitan students (N=40), this study shows higher brain activity in listening to familiar music for both piano and Karawitan students. Moreover, the dominant brain activity happened in temporal lobe when subject listened to familiar music and frontal lobe when subject listened to unfamiliar music

Title: Fluctuation-dissipation in accelerated frames
Word count: 3424
Abstract: An uniformly accelerated (Rindler) observer will detect particles in theMinkowski vacuum, known as Unruh effect. The spectrum is thermal and thetemperature is given by that of the Killing horizon, which is proportional tothe acceleration. Considering these particles are kept in a thermal bath withthis temperature, we find that the correlation function of the random force dueto radiation acting on the particles as measured by the accelerated frame,shows the fluctuation-dissipation relation. It is observed that thecorrelations, in both ($1+1$) spacetime and ($1+3$) dimensional spacetimes, areof Brownian type. We discuss the implications of this new observation at theend.Comment: The para above Eq. (6) has been modified, to appear in Phys. Rev.

basic summary: Hence for our practical purpose we keep our region of integra- tion from X = X(T ) to X →∞. Following the steps of , we obtain F (T ) = −X ′(T )T 01[T,X(T )] + T 00[T,X(T )] , (2) where X ′(T ) = dX/dT . 3Then, it follows that the the correlation function of the random force is dependant upon the correlation function of the spacetime derivatives of the scalar field. Therefore, the observer moves from X = X(T ), which is given by the equation for the path, to∞. Correlation Function in Minkowski Spacetime: The correlation function is determined by taking the aver- age of product of the random force amplitudes at two different time-points T1 and T2. (10), that x˜0 = x01 − x 0 2 is finite while x˜ 1 = x11 − x 1 2 is very small. Here, the integration spans from X = X(T ) to ∞.

sim_matrix summary: C. Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem in Time Domain: In the time domain, the fluctuation-dissipation theorem rep- resents the relation between the correlation function of the random fluctuating force to the coefficient [say α] of the mean dissipative force, as [1, 2, 17] α = β lim ω→0 K˜(ω) 2 , (21) where K˜(ω) is the Fourier modes of correlation function which is given by (18). Fluctuating force and correlation in Minkowski spacetime: In this section, we will compute the correlation function of the random force in the (1 + 1)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime by first taking a definition of the reaction force on the particle due to its interaction with the scalar field bath. Correlation Function in Rindler Spacetime: The rela- tions between the Minkowski and Rindler coordinates in proper time τ are T = 1 a sinh(aτ); X = 1 a cosh(aτ) − 1 a , (10) where a is the acceleration. Correlation function in Rindler frame and fluctuation-dissipation theorem: Since the particles are observed from the accelerated frame, to determine the behaviour of these particles we need to write the correla- tion function (4) in Rindler proper time coordintes. (4) can be de- termined from the Schwinger function, the most general form of which is given by [7] Smnrs(x 1, x 2) = 〈Tmn[x 1]Trs[x 2]〉 = A( x˜ 2 )4 [(3gmngrs − gmrgns − gmsgnr) (x˜ 2)2 − 4x˜2 (gmnx˜rx˜s + grsx˜mx˜n) + 8x˜mx˜nx˜rx˜s] , (5) where A is an arbitrary constant, related to the central charge C of the particular fields by A = C/4π2, x˜a = xa1 − x a 2 and x˜ 2 = −(x01 − x 0 2) 2 + (x11 − x 1 2) 2. 3Then, it follows that the the correlation function of the random force is dependant upon the correlation function of the spacetime derivatives of the scalar field. It has been observed that the correlation function for the random force acting on the particles, in the very small accelera- tion regime, obey fluctuation-dissipation theorem which exists in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.

tfidf summary: The metric signature is taken to be (−,+). C. Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem in Time Domain: In the time domain, the fluctuation-dissipation theorem rep- resents the relation between the correlation function of the random fluctuating force to the coefficient [say α] of the mean dissipative force, as [1, 2, 17] α = β lim ω→0 K˜(ω) 2 , (21) where K˜(ω) is the Fourier modes of correlation function which is given by (18). Correlation function in Rindler frame and fluctuation-dissipation theorem: Since the particles are observed from the accelerated frame, to determine the behaviour of these particles we need to write the correla- tion function (4) in Rindler proper time coordintes. Hence, it can be safely said that the correlation func- tion of the random force is related to the correlation function of the energy-momentum tensor. Considering these particles are kept in a thermal bath with this temperature, we find that the symmetric and anti-symmetric combinations of correlation function for the random force, acting of them, satisfies the fluctuation-dissipation theorem in the small acceleration limit. C. Determining the energy-momentum tensor correla- tions: The correlation functions of the energy-momentum tensor components that appears in eq. The Langevin equation shows that the driving force behind the motion of the immersed particle can be decomposed into three parts - (a) the external force exerted by external agents that the particle is subjected to, (b) the slowly-varying averaged force that tends to drive the system to an equilibrium state, and (c) the rapidly fluctuating random force.

frequency summary: Keeping this in mind and us- ing the expression (3) for random force at two different spacetime points x 1(X1, T1) and x 2(X2, T2), we get the expression for the correlation function to be 〈R(T1)R(T2)〉 = X ′ 1(T1)X ′ 2(T2) 〈 T 01[x 1]T 01[x 2] 〉 −X ′1(T1) 〈 T 01[x 1]T 00[x 2] 〉 −X ′2(T2) 〈 T 00[x 1]T 01[x 2] 〉 + 〈 T 00[x 1]T 00[x 2] 〉 (4) where one needs to keep in mind that after calculation one has to use X1 = X1(T1) and so on. (4) are then determined to be 〈 T 01[x 1]T 01[x 2] 〉 = A( x˜ 2 )4 [( x˜ 2 )2 + 8(x˜0)2(x˜1)2 ] (6) 〈 T 01[x 1]T 00[x 2] 〉 = A( x˜ 2 )4 [4x˜ 2x˜0x˜1 + 8(x˜0)3x˜1] (7) 〈 T 00[x 1]T 01[x 2] 〉 = A( x˜ 2 )4 [4x˜ 2x˜0x˜1 + 8(x˜0)3x˜1] (8) 〈 T 00[x 1]T 00[x 2] 〉 = A( x˜ 2 )4 [( x˜ 2 )2 + 8(x˜0)2(x˜1)2 ] . (4) can be de- termined from the Schwinger function, the most general form of which is given by [7] Smnrs(x 1, x 2) = 〈Tmn[x 1]Trs[x 2]〉 = A( x˜ 2 )4 [(3gmngrs − gmrgns − gmsgnr) (x˜ 2)2 − 4x˜2 (gmnx˜rx˜s + grsx˜mx˜n) + 8x˜mx˜nx˜rx˜s] , (5) where A is an arbitrary constant, related to the central charge C of the particular fields by A = C/4π2, x˜a = xa1 − x a 2 and x˜ 2 = −(x01 − x 0 2) 2 + (x11 − x 1 2) 2. (12) Rewriting the expression in terms of the two points x 1(x 1 1, T1) and x 2(x 1 2, T2) again, the above equation be- comes 〈R(T1)R(T2)〉 = A [ −(T1 − T2)2 + (X1(T1)−X2(T2))2] 2 . Fluctuating force and correlation in Minkowski spacetime: In this section, we will compute the correlation function of the random force in the (1 + 1)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime by first taking a definition of the reaction force on the particle due to its interaction with the scalar field bath. The symmetric and and anti-symmetric correlation functions are then defined as K+(s) = 1 2 [〈F (t0)F (t0 + s)〉+ 〈F (t0 + s)F (t0)〉] = 1 2 [K(s) +K(−s)] , (15) and K−(s) = 1 2 [〈F (t0)F (t0 + s)〉 − 〈F (t0 + s)F (t0)〉] = 1 2 [K(s)−K(−s)] . Correlation Function in Rindler Spacetime: The rela- tions between the Minkowski and Rindler coordinates in proper time τ are T = 1 a sinh(aτ); X = 1 a cosh(aτ) − 1 a , (10) where a is the acceleration.

Title: A simple but tough-to-beat baseline for the Fake News Challenge stance  detection task
Word count: 1890
Abstract: Identifying public misinformation is a complicated and challenging task. Animportant part of checking the veracity of a specific claim is to evaluate thestance different news sources take towards the assertion. Automatic stanceevaluation, i.e. stance detection, would arguably facilitate the process offact checking. In this paper, we present our stance detection system whichclaimed third place in Stage 1 of the Fake News Challenge. Despite ourstraightforward approach, our system performs at a competitive level with thecomplex ensembles of the top two winning teams. We therefore propose our systemas the 'simple but tough-to-beat baseline' for the Fake News Challenge stancedetection task.Comment: 6 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables; additional reference and details added,  typos and wording correcte

More specifically, FNC-1 involved developing a model that, given a news article headline and a news article body, estimates the stance of the body towards the headline. We therefore propose our model as the ‘simple but tough-to-beat baseline’ for the Fake News Challenge stance detection task. The performance of our model is summarised by below confusion matrix for the label predictions submitted on the final test set (see Table 2).

Title: Determination of Boltzmann constant by equipartition theorem for  capacitors
Word count: 1260
Abstract: A new experimental set-up for Boltzmann constant measurement is described.Statistically averaged square of voltage $\left<U^2\right>$ is measured fordifferent capacitances $C$. Boltzmann constant is determined by theequipartition theorem $C\left<U^2\right>=k_{_\mathrm{B}}T$. For fixedcapacitance, voltages could be measured for different temperatures. The set-upconsists of low-noise high frequency operational amplifiers ADA4898-2. Aninstrumental amplifier is followed by an inverting amplifier, square of thevoltage is created by an analog multiplier AD633 and finally the averagedsignal is measured by a multimeter.Comment: 14 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables, 2 appendice

basic summary: Statistically averaged square of voltage 〈 U2 〉 is measured for different capacitances C. Boltzmann constant is determined by the equipartition theorem C 〈 U2 〉 = kBT . The purpose of the present work is to present a simple self- made set-up for determination of Boltzmann constant in high- school and student laboratories. The prob- lem of the floating of the zero is solved with large fast capac- itors sequentially connected to the gain resistors of the circuit depicted at Fig. Table of the calculated parameters necessary for the anal- ysis of the circuit (time constants, frequencies, voltages and lin- ear amplification). One can easily see the 2 dual ADA48986 operational amplifiers in a SOIC package, the 3 large WIMA capacitors,7 and the multiplier AD6334 in a PDIP package.

sim_matrix summary: Statistically averaged square of voltage 〈 U2 〉 is measured for different capacitances C. Boltzmann constant is determined by the equipartition theorem C 〈 U2 〉 = kBT . THEORY The time averaged square of the investigated voltage 〈 U2 〉 and the constant voltage measured by a voltmeter V is related by a constant with dimension of voltage U∗〈 U2 〉 = U∗V. (4) gives a linear dependence between the DC voltage V and the inverse capacitance 1/C V = α 1 C + β, k B = αU∗ T , (6) where the slope of the straight line determines the Boltzmann constant. INTRODUCTION In the beginning of the development of statistical physics Albert Einstein suggested1 that Boltzmann constant kB can be determined using the equipartition theorem for thermally averaged square of the voltage 〈 U2 〉 of a capacitor C C 〈 U2 〉 = k B T. (1) The first attempt for the realization of this idea was made by Habicht brothers2 in 1910 but unfortunately their electrostatic amplifier with mechanically rotating parts suffered from float- ing of the zero.

tfidf summary: The voltages V1 and V are measured with multimeters. Later on the signal has to be squared by an analog multiplier, this squared signal has to be averaged by a low-pass filter and finally the time averaged signal V is measured by an ordinary multimeter. The achieved accuracy for determination of Boltzmann constant is rather poor kB ≈ (1.92± 5%)× 10−23 J/K, (7) the systematic error is around 40% but it is a good beginning for a $50 set-up which can be further elaborated.

Title: A General and Adaptive Robust Loss Function
Word count: 2027
Abstract: We present a generalization of the Cauchy/Lorentzian, Geman-McClure,Welsch/Leclerc, generalized Charbonnier, Charbonnier/pseudo-Huber/L1-L2, and L2loss functions. By introducing robustness as a continous parameter, our lossfunction allows algorithms built around robust loss minimization to begeneralized, which improves performance on basic vision tasks such asregistration and clustering. Interpreting our loss as the negative log of aunivariate density yields a general probability distribution that includesnormal and Cauchy distributions as special cases. This probabilisticinterpretation enables the training of neural networks in which the robustnessof the loss automatically adapts itself during training, which improvesperformance on learning-based tasks such as generative image synthesis andunsupervised monocular depth estimation, without requiring any manual parametertuning

basic summary: Our loss is valid for all real values of α and for all real, positive values of c. The loss increases monotonically with the magnitude of x. In this paper we present a single loss function that is a superset of many of these com- mon loss functions. Loss Function With this analysis in place, we can present our final loss function. As as result, this loss may be useful to practitioners wishing to easily and continuously explore a wide variety of robust loss functions.

sim_matrix summary: The generalized Charbonnier loss builds upon the Charbonnier loss function [3], which is generally defined as: f (x, c) = √ x2 + c2 (1) This loss sometimes is written in a reparameterized form: f (x, c) = c √ (x/c) 2 + 1 (2) This form of the loss is sometimes referred to as “L1-L2” loss (as it behaves like quadratic loss near the origin and like absolute loss far from the origin) or a Pseudo-Huber loss (due to its resemblance to the classic Huber loss func- tion [7]). ρ (x, α, c) = log ( 1 2 ( x/c) 2 + 1 ) if α = 0 1− exp ( − 12 (x/c)2 ) if α = −∞ z(α) α (( (x/c)2 z(α) + 1 )(α/2) − 1 ) otherwise (13) z(α) = max (1, 2− α) (14) As we have shown, this loss function is a superset of the generalized Charbonnier loss function (and therefore the the Charbonnier / L1-L2 / pseudo-Huber, quadratic and ab- solute loss functions by transitivity) and is also a superset of the Cauchy / Lorentzian, Geman-McClure, and Welsch / Leclerc loss functions. As is already well-known, L2 loss is a special case of the generalized Charbonnier, and this remains true in our reparametrization: h (x, 2, c) = 1 2 (x/c) 2 (8) Though L1 loss is a special case of the generalized Char- bonnier loss in it’s traditional form, true L1 loss is not actu- ally expressible in our normalized form in Equation 6 due to the division by c. But if we assume that x is much greater than c, we see that our normalized form approaches L1 loss: h (x, 1, c) ≈ |x| c − 1 if x c (9) Unlike the generalized Charbonnier loss, our normalized loss can be shown to be a generalization of two other com- mon loss functions. By setting α = −2, our loss is equivalent to Geman-McClure loss [5]: h (x,−2, c) = 2 ( x/c) 2 (x/c) 2 + 4 (11) And in the limit as α approaches negative infinity, our loss becomes Welsch [9] (aka Leclerc [11]) loss: lim α→−∞h (x, α, c) = 1− exp ( −1 2 (x/c) 2 ) (12) The Welsch and Geman-McClure losses are therefore spe- cial cases of our loss, or equivalently, our loss function can be viewed as a generalization of the Welsch and Geman- McClure loss functions.

Title: Diffusion-like recommendation with enhanced similarity of objects
Word count: 3833
Abstract: In last decades, diversity and accuracy have been regarded as two importantmeasures in evaluating a recommendation model. However, a clear concern is thata model focusing excessively on one measure will put the other one at risk,thus it is not easy to greatly improve diversity and accuracy simultaneously.In this paper, we propose to enhance the Resource-Allocation (RA) similarity inresource transfer equations of diffusion-like models, by giving a tunableexponent to the RA similarity, and traversing the value of the exponent toachieve the optimal recommendation results. In this way, we can increase therecommendation scores (allocated resource) of many unpopular objects.Experiments on three benchmark data sets, MovieLens, Netflix, and RateYourMusicshow that the modified models can yield remarkable performance improvementcompared with the original ones

basic summary: A random recommendation will randomly choose L objects from the train set and recommend them to the target user, where L is the length of the recommendation list. The niche objects will receive lower final resources (recommendation scores) because they have fewer neighbor users (resource portals), thus rank in the bottom of the recommendation lists. Sun et al.

Word count: 3488
Abstract: As parallel to industrialization and increasing population, pressures on natural resources have rised, soil, water and air have been polluted. These problems threaten the human. So, environmental protection or in awider meaning nature conservation became a very important duty for the human in this century. The duty is a special action against eradication of living base for the organisms Forest ecosystems are of course economical natural resources. The ecosystem is a monotonous forest area by compositions, characteristics and relationsihips of the main elements within the forest. In the article, firstly, forest ecosystems and their functions were examined, then, importance of forest as natural resources, their roles for preventing risk of climatically changes, and contribution of forests for sustainable development within Turkiye were studied

basic summary: It is important to remember that forests play a key role in combating climate change with carbon sequestration, as well as by reducing the impact of climate change. GLOBAL WARMING AND EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE The effect of greenhouse gases on the emergence of earth's climate and climate has undeniable precaution. CLIMATE CHANGE AND FORESTS There is a two-way relationship between climate change and forest ecosystem. Therefore, it is of great importance to protect forest areas and to increase carbon capture capacity of forests to combat climate change (OGM; 2011). Since the mid-1990s, global warming and climate change have become an irrefutable fact of mankind The forests that make up an important ecosystem of our country are climate sensitive. Globally, the rate of decline of forest carbon is estimated to be 1.6 billion tons per year, with 0.25% of total forest carbon.

Title: Combination of the Isochoric Method and the Expansion Method to Determine Densities of Hydrogen at Temperatures Up to 500°c
Word count: 3267
Abstract: Utilization of hydrogen as an alternative fuel is promising because it is environmentally friendly. Hydrogen system design requires accurate hydrogen densities. The density of hydrogen is determined based on experimental data. For gases that have a low density such as hydrogen, the effective measurement method is required. An apparatus has been designed to measure PVT properties of hydrogen at pressures up to 1 MPa and temperatures up to 500ºC. The apparatus uses a combination of isochoric and expansion methods. The method doesn\u27t need a measurement of pressures and temperatures along the isochoric line as required usually in the isochoric conventional method. Moreover, it doesn\u27t need direct measurements of gas mass and gas volume. The volume was determined by measuring nitrogen at a pressure of 0.5 MPa and at temperatures up to 500ºC and by using Span\u27s equation of state. Measurements of hydrogen have been performed at a pressure up to 0.7 MPa and temperatures up to 498.217ºC. Densities of hydrogen obtained from the present measurement are compared with that obtained from calculation of Leachman\u27s equation of state. Maximum deviation is 1.42% at a temperature of 498.217ºC and at a pressure of 0.2947 MPa and minimum deviation is 0.11% at temperature and pressure of 399.461ºC and 0.6981 MPa respectively

basic summary: After expanding the sample gas, the condition in the sample cell and the expansion cell are maintained until the pressure and temperature reach stability both in temperature and pressure. The results show that the hydrogen gas pressure in the sample cell and the expansion cell becomes very low after the expansion. The hydrogen measurement begins with flushing the sample cell, the expansion cell, and the connecting pipes five times using nitrogen gas. The amount of gas mass in the sample cell (mA) and expansion cell (mB) after opening K2 valve are equal to the gas density before the expansion (m0). The combination of the isochoric and the expansion methods The sample cell and expansion cell are evacuated in advance before performing a gas measurement. The connection between the pressure transducer with the sample cell and the pressure transducer with the expansion cell is a 0.4 mm in diameter capillary tube. Furthermore, by using the nitrogen densities, the volume ratio of the expansion cell and the sample cell is determined by using Equ. Then temperature and pressure in the sample cell and the expansion cell are measured. The densities of hydrogen in the sample cell and the expansion cell as required to calculate the Equ. The gas mass inside the sample cell and the expansion cell after opening K2 valve are mA and mB respectively. This system is required to anticipate accumulation of hydrogen gas in the container if hydrogen gas leaking occurred from the sample cell to the airtight container. The temperature stability during measurement in the sample cell and the expansion cell is estimated to be ± 10 mK.

Title: Role of Genetic Testing in Male Infertility
Word count: 3443
Abstract: Male-factor infertility is responsible for 30-55% of all infertility cases. The causes of male infertility include varicocele, endocrine disorders, genital tract infections, genetic disorders and idiopathic. It is estimated that genetic abnormalities contribute to 50% of male infertility. In daily practice, the diagnosis of male infertility has been based on history taking, relevant physical examination, hormone tests and basic semen analysis with a strong emphasis on the assessment of sperm concentration, motility, and morphology. Although recent development in assisted-reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization and intrauterine insemination increases the chance of clinical pregnancy and live birth, genetic counseling and testing should always beperformed whenever genetic risks are related to the cause of infertility for the identification of possible genetic abnormalities and to assess the risk of transmitting the genetic defects to future generations. Genetic defects affect male infertility by disrupting hormonal homeostasis, spermatogenesis, and sperm quality. These genetic defects include chromosomal abnormalities (e.g. Klinefelter Syndrome), Y chromosome deletions, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene mutations. The utilization of genetic counseling and testing is also important to predict the success of sperm retrieval in men with certain genetic abnormalities. Toname a few, genetic analysis at the chromosomal level (karyotyping), androgen receptor gene mutations test, cystic fibrosis test, and Y chromosome microdeletions analysis should be considered in the diagnosis of male factor infertility where genetic risks are present

basic summary: Y Chromosome Deletions Y chromosome deletions are the second most common genetic abnormalities affecting male infertility after KS. The utilization of genetic counseling and testing is also important to predict the success of sperm retrieval in men with certain genetic abnormalities. However, although the development of ART increases the chance of sperm retrieval among men with azoospermia, it does not prevent the transmission of genetic defects to the offspring. Genetic markers of male infertility: Y chromosome microdeletions and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance gene mutations. Nowadays, genetic causes of male infertility have been recognized, whereas genetic counseling of infertile couples has markedly improved. Genetic defects affect male infertility by disrupting hormonal homeostasis, spermatogenesis, and sperm quality. Chromosomal defects contribute as the most frequent genetic abnormalities affecting male infertility. The causes of male infertility include varicocele, endocrine disorders, genital tract infections, genetic disorders and idiopathic. Genetic abnormalities among severely oligospermic men who are candidates for intracytoplasmic sperm injection. However, men with certain genetic defects can also produce sperm, although, with aneuploidies.

sim_matrix summary: This condition contributes to 40% of all  azoospermia cases.6 NOA is the most common  form of azoospermia and it is caused by conditions  other than hypothalamic-pituitary disease and  obstruction of the male genital tract.7 Genetic disorders account for 15-30% of  azoospermia,8 whereas idiopathic male infertility,  in which there are normal findings on physical  examination and endocrine, genetic and biochemical  laboratory testing, is found in 12-41% of all  azoospermia cases and it is likely that most of this case  has underlying genetic causes.4 Common genetic  disorders that may cause male infertility include  chromosomal abnormalities (Klinefelter Syndrome/ KS, Robertsonian translocation), Y chromosome  deletions, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane  conductance regulator (CFTR) gene mutation.9 The invention of assisted reproductive  technology (ART) has increased the chance of men  with azoospermia to have offspring. Children of men with Y chromosome deletions,  for example, can inherit the defects as well as  having an increased chance of having whole Y  chromosome deletions.10 Therefore, in addition to  the basic diagnostic strategy for male infertility,  which often comprises of history taking, physical  examination, endocrine testing, semen analysis,  and imaging studies, further diagnostic investigation  involving genetic counseling and testing is needed  not only for diagnostic purpose, but also to make  a prognosis of sperm retrieval result and to take  necessary precautions to prevent the transmission  of genetic defects to offspring.11 Genetic Abnormalities Related to Male Infertility Genetic abnormalities associated with male  infertility could be manifested in both OA and NOA  phenotypes (Table 1).

They contribute to 1% of all  male infertility and usually show as azoospermia  phenotype than oligozoospermia.4 Alteration of the  gene expression pattern of the spermatozoa at many  stages is found in Robertsonian translocations,31  while impaired semen parameters or sperm  aneuploidies are found among men with reciprocal  translocations, although the exact mechanism is  still not known.4 In addition to KS, other numerical  chromosome abnormalities with variable fertility status  can also occur, such as 47,XYY and 45,X/46,XY  mosaicism.8Although phenotypically normal, men  with 47,XYY karyotype may have spermatogenesis  failure, maturation arrest, or SCOS.9 Androgens (testosterone and 5α-dihydrotestosterone/ DHT) are the hormones that regulate the development and  maintenance of spermatogenesis.4 The androgen receptor  (AR) is encoded by a gene located on the X chromo- some and consequently, mutations in this gene cause  a collection of defects known as androgen insensitivity  syndrome (AIS). However, it is  reported that routine semen analysis with emphasis  on sperm concentration, motility, morphology alone  is not enough in the diagnosis of male infertility.32  In large centers, genetic counseling with genetic  testing of male infertility using chromosomal  analysis such as karyotyping, AR gene mutations  test, CF test, and Y chromosome microdeletion  analysis have been employed routinely.4 Genetic counseling involves a discussion of  possible genetic conditions affecting male fertility  and its importance in the routine assessment of male  infertility. However, in certain cases,  the offspring has larger genetic defects and the  process will continue to future generations.33 According to the European Association of  Urology (EAU), standard karyotype analysis  must be performed to all men with a sperm  concentration <10 million/mL who are seeking  fertility treatment by IVF.34 Based on the American  Urological Association (AUA), karyotyping and  genetic counseling should be offered to all patients  with NOA and severe oligozoospermia with sperm  concentration <5 million/mL.35 Regarding Y chromosome microdeletions, the  EAU stated that testing for microdeletions is not  necessary in men with OA but should be offered  to men with sperm concentration <5 million/mL  for diagnostic and prognostic purpose. Men with  complete AZFa or AZFb microdeletions are not  advised to undergo sperm retrieval procedure as  it is unlikely that any sperm will be found.34 The  AUA, however, stated that although the prognosis  for sperm retrieval is poor for patients with AZFa  or AZFb deletions, the results of Y chromosome  deletion analysis are not able to absolutely  predict the absence of sperm.35 The EAU and  AUA guidelines agree that in men with congenital  bilateral absence of the vas deferens, both partners  should be tested for CFTR gene mutations.34,35 Conclusion The availability of sperm retrieval techniques  to obtain sperm from men with azoospermia or  severe oligozoospermia enables couples who  previously had little chance of having children  to conceive with the help of ART techniques. Sperm in the ejaculate  or the testis is found in approximately 60% of men  with AZFc deletions.9 The availability of sperm retrieval techniques  to obtain sperm from men with Y chromosome  microdeletions facilitates the transmission of genetic  abnormalities to their children as male offspring of  men with AZF deletions also carry the deletion and  will have impaired spermatogenesis in adulthood.9  Foresta et al29 reported in 2005 that men with  AZF genes deletions had a significantly reduced  percentage of normal Y-bearing spermatozoa  compared to men with normozoospermia (p<0.01). Approximately 1 in 600  newborn males is affected by KS.14 The term  KS originated from Harry F. Klinefelter, who in  1942 described for the first time a clinical entity  of men with gynecomastia, small testes, absent  spermatogenesis, normal to moderate reduction  of Leydig cell function and an increased level  of FSH.15 KS is caused by a supernumerary X  chromosome with 80% of men with KS are of the  non-mosaic 47,XXY karyotype, while the other  20% are of the 46,XY/47,XXY mosaicism.16 Ferlin  et al9 reported that 76.6% of non-mosaic KS had  complete azoospermia, while among the mosaic  46,XY/47,XXY men, 74.4% were azoospermic. Boys with KS usually show some symptoms  such as speech development delay, learning  disabilities, or behavioral problems.20 Increased  height velocity rate is usually notable between  the age of 5 to 8, but differentiating between boys  with KS and normal boys based on the physical  appearance is difficult as the magnitude or timing  of pubertal growth spurt does not differ significantly  between boys with KS and normal boys.21 The  abnormality is usually diagnosed after puberty,  when men with KS start noticing small testicular  size and symptoms of androgen deficiency with  most of the patients diagnosed when they are  unable to conceive and sperm analysis shows  azoospermia.20 Early recognition of the signs and  symptoms of KS, together with confirmation by  karyotyping are of vital value in the diagnosis of KS.

Title: Effect of Different Shade Levels on Growth and Yield Performances of Cauliflower
Word count: 2579
Abstract: An experiment was conducted during March to July in 2017 (off season) at the Faculty of Agriculture, University of Jaffna, Ariviyal Nagar, Kilinochchi to study the effects of different shade levels on growth and yield performances of cauliflower. Different shade levels such as 25 % (open field), 50 % (single net house) and 75 % (double net house) were used as treatments. The experiment was conducted in completely randomized design (CRD) with four replications. Parametric (growth & yield) analysis were done by using SAS 9.1 package. The influence of environmental variables such as temperature, relative humidity and light intensity were also studied.The result revealed that growing of cauliflower in different shade levels showed great influence on plant growth and yield attributes. There were significant variations in number of leaves, plant height,curd weight, curd diameter and curd circumference of cauliflower under different light intensities. Light intensity in the shade net house was lower than in the open field. The highest vegetative growth and yield were observed in cauliflower which was grown in 50 % shade levels and the lowest yield was in 25 % shade level (open field). It can be concluded that cauliflower can be cultivated in 50 % shade levels successfully to produce quality curd during off season of the dry zone of Sri Lanka

basic summary: We also find students’ relationship to different political parties and other social, religious outfits fight in groups leading to bloodshed and cause police interference or action. Githa Hariharan, the author of the novel, is expert sufficient to describe campus life and campus politics in attractive and articulate manner for her different readership. Although he talked about individual freedom for women but his ideology for married women remain restricted to separate spheres. Mill argument is simply an extension to women of the enlightenment belief and women’s subordination was a barbarous relic of past. The Second sex is a1949 book by French existentialist Simone de Beauvoir, in which the author deliberates the action of women through history.

Abstract: With the rapid development of society and the economy, an increasing number of human activities have gradually destroyed the marine environment. GeoSoc a node can take one of the following states: SINK: The master node of the whole network manager of receiving all the information that is collected by all the sensor nodes that make up the different clusters used for monitoring desired area. Cluster head: The node that coordinates a group of nodes that are part of a cluster and are responsible for the monitoring of an assigned area. Is responsible for establishing direct connection with the SINK node to  transmit the information collected for all its sensor nodes. In case of losing SINK contact, can make use of a node. Gateway: A node that has connection with two Cluster head or a sensor node that does not reach its Cluster head. This type of nodes is used to increase network coverage and reduce loss connection by the nodes that make up the net.•Sensor Member: These nodes are responsible for Collect the information you want to monitor. Is the state that a node takes when it has already established Cluster head connection to a node? • Disconnected: A node has this been in two situations, 1) when it is activated for the first time and have to look for the cluster to which must be connected, 2) when it loses connection with its coordinator node and you have to perform the search for a new node coordinator

basic summary: In many instances, individual members of a political party must follow the dynamics of the leaders and officials of the ruling political party. Yogyakarta: Faculty of Social and Political Sciences, University of Gadjah Mada. Many parties requires members to always want to submit and adhere to the policy of top officials, but would like to in the recall. The dynamics of both impact on the sort of political turmoil, economic, social, and security. Competition among political party members were relatively the same with outside parties, could trigger a civil war and bloodshed unnecessary. Election then become a means of political power struggles that are general and open, at least for the two areas, namely the executive authority and the legislative authorities. In many cases, the popularity of someone much exploited by the parties 'talent', both from political parties and / or capitalist. In the political field, their association to form political parties. New faces who appear in public can be a proving ground, the promotion's popularity, and elektabilitas of potential members of political parties.

Title: C-N-Codoped TiO2 Synthesis by Using Peroxo Sol Gel Method for Photocatalytic Reduction of Cr(VI)
Word count: 2364
Abstract: C-N-codoped TiO2 (CNTO) photocatalysts were successfully synthesized by using “green” method peroxo sol-gel. XRD results revealed the presence of anatase phase only for all samples. The result of Scanning Electron Microscope-Electron Dispersive X-Ray (SEM-EDX) showed surface morphology of CNTO10 was spherical (44 nm) and homogeneous.  Diffuse Reflectance Spectra UV-Vis (DRS UV-Vis) result showed red shift in absorbance indicating successful modification of TiO2 by C and N. The result of photocatalytic activity in reducing Cr(VI) showed that  the Cr(VI) reduction  increase with the increase of irradiation time and photocatalyst\u27s mass.  The highest Cr(VI) reduction was 90.07% for CNTO10 sample. This is due to the synergistic effects of C and N dopants that improves  TiO2 photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation

basic summary: The optimal carbon concentration for synthesizing C-N- codoped TiO2 was 10 wt% due to its excellent reduction efficiency under visible light irradiation (90.07% in 150 min). The increase of mass and irradiation time were increased the coalition between photocatalysts, visible light and Cr(VI) solution as the result the reduction efficiency was higher. CNTO10 was representing as prepared codoped TiO2 due to its highest phocatalytic activity for Cr(VI) reduction under visible light irradiation. TiO2 was successfully modified by N and C, narrowed TiO2 band gap, and increased photocatalytic activity in reduction of Cr(VI) solution. This is due to the synergistic effects of C and N dopants that improves TiO2 photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation. Furthermore, a few publications have been published about photocatalytic activity reduction of Cr(VI) with multi-non-metal-codoped TiO2 material under visible light irradiation.

Word count: 2544
Abstract: The human hair harbors several species of fungi and also bacteria. The present study was performed to determine the prevalence of keratinophilic fungi and bacteria from hair samples of femalesfrom November 2016 to April 2017. A total of 50 human hair samples were examinedusing hair-baiting techniques for isolation. After the incubation period, the number of colony forming unit was counted. The microorganisms were identified based on the colony morphology from culture and microscopic features. After purification, each representative colony was gram-stained and examined for cell morphology and gram reaction under a light microscope. Fungal isolates included were Aspergillus Niger, Aspergillus flavus, Penicilliumspp, Alternaria alternata, Chrysosporium keratinophilum. Cladosporium cladosporioides and Trichosporon mucoides. Isolated bacterial species included gram positive bacteria such as  Leuconostoc mesenteroidess spcremoris, Kocuriarosea, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and the gram negative bacteria Kocurikristinae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Micrococcus luteu/ lylae. Human hair samples from females studied were found have several fungal and bacterial isolates, some of which can cause some serious disease in humans. Healt

basic summary: The present study was performed to determine the prevalence of keratinophilic fungi and bacteria from hair samples of femalesfrom November 2016 to April 2017. Human hair samples from females studied were found have several fungal and bacterial isolates, some of which can cause some serious disease in humans. A total of 27colonies of different keratinophilic fungi were isolated from 50 hair samples. Plant extracts which suppressed the fungal growth were tested for their efficiency against the fungi isolated from hair by tested the disc diffusion method. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of keratinophilic fungi and bacteria in the hair of females in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Keratinophilic fungi are usually isolated from the soil and from keratinous tissues such as the skin, hair and nails. (Lange-Asschenfeldt et al., 2011) The human hair is also a reservoir of bacterial including Staphycoccusintermedius and coagulase-negative Staphylococci (Mase et al, 2000), and Staphylococcus aureus (Jappe, 2003). Key words— keratinophilic fungi, microbial and fungal flora,female hair. Isolated bacterial species included gram positive bacteria such as Leuconostoc mesenteroidess spcremoris, Kocuriarosea, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and the gram negative bacteria Kocurikristinae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Micrococcus luteu/ lylae. There were very limited reports on keratinophilic fungi and bacterial colonization on the hair. Therefore hygiene protocol should be taken to prevent the spread of pathogenic fungi in these environments as there is a risk of fungal infections of human.

Title: Petrography and Mineralogy of Amphibolite Rocks in Penjween Complex, Northeastern Iraq
Word count: 2836
Abstract: Penjween igneous complex is situated in the northeastern part of the Iraqi Zagros Thrust Zone (IZTZ) which is considered as integral part of the Alpine-Himalayan Orogenic Belt of Cretaceous age. The amphibolite rocks exist in Penjween as pods of lensoid-shape of variable sizes (2-3m). These amphibolite pods are surrounded by sheared tectonized serpentinite and peridotite and one is in contact with amphibole-bearing gabbro dike. In addition, there is an albitite dyke in contact with the amphibolite. These amphibolites exhibit deformation and alteration which is evident by the existence of chlorite veins cutting through or as patches within these rocks. Petrographic observations reveal that the main mineral constituents are amphibole; both primary and secondary, plagioclase with accessory clinopyroxene, quartz, titanite, apatite, zircon and iron oxides. Secondary minerals include chlorite, epidote, secondary amphibole and iron oxides as a consequence of alteration. Dominated textures are porphyroblastic, poikiloblastic, nematoblastic , blasto-ophitic and blasto-subophitic which are inherited from the original rocks. Accordingly, two mineral assemblages are identified: 1- Hb. + plag. + cpx.&plusmn; qtz. &plusmn; titanite &plusmn; zircon &plusmn; apatite &plusmn; iron oxides, 2- Hb. + plag. &plusmn; qtz. &plusmn; titanite &plusmn; apatite &plusmn; zircon &plusmn; iron oxides &plusmn; chl. &plusmn; sericite &plusmn; ep. The secondary assemblage is more altered. On the basis of Mg/(Mg+Fe)-Si per formula of the analyzed amphibole, two types of amphibole are observed; Mg-hornblende and tschermakite. Chemical analyses of the plagioclase grains give two types; oligoclase (An23.9 Ab75.9 ) and albite (An1.7 Ab97.9)

Title: Effects of Socio-Economic factors of Loan Administrators on Recovery Rate among Agricultural Cooperatives in Benue State, Nigeria
Word count: 1844
Abstract: This study was undertaken to analyze the effect of socio-economic factors of loan administrators on loan recovery rate among agricultural co-operatives in Benue State of Nigeria. A purposive and simple random sampling technique was used to select 130 respondents. Data were collected using structured questionnaire and was analyzed using descriptive statistics and multiple regression. The result showed that majority of the respondents were male (58.46%), married (67.69%), educated (63.01%), with mean cooperative experience of 14.39 years (86.92%) and household size between 1 - 5 members. The result also showed that respondents were averagely young (36 years) and were relatively low income earners (N 2,480,000 per annum). The result shows that loan size was the only variable that significantly and positively affected loan recovery rate.  The coefficients of salary, age, years in education, household size, cooperative experience, marital status and sex had no effect on recovery rate.   It was recommended that administrators should give higher portfolio size loans as these will trigger them to carefully look at business activities in their coverage areas that are capable of repaying loans from precede of sales and cash flow

The portrayal of woman in Indian English fiction  as the silent victim and up holder of the tradition and  traditional norms of family and society in India has  undergone a tremendous change and is no longer presented  as a passive character.
