Title: Nadir Echo Removal in Synthetic Aperture Radar via Waveform Diversity and Dual-Focus Postprocessing
Word count: 3373
Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing allows high-resolution imaging independent of weather conditions and sunlight illumination and is, therefore, very attractive for the systematic observation of dynamic processes on the earth's surface. However, as a consequence of the pulsed operation and side-looking geometry of SAR, nadir echoes may significantly affect the SAR image quality, if the pulse repetition frequency is not conveniently constrained in the design of the SAR system. As the nadir interference constraint typically limits both the swath width and the ambiguity performance of the SAR system, the investigation of novel concepts for nadir echo removal is of great interest. This letter describes how to design an SAR system without the nadir interference constraint and how to remove (not only smear) the nadir echoes by means of waveform diversity on transmit and appropriate postprocessing. The proposed technique yields improved image quality and can be exploited in a similar manner for range ambiguity suppression with remarkable benefits for the design of novel SAR systems

Once raw data are focused with a filter matched to the nadir echo, the nadir echo can be simply removed by blanking the pixels, where it is located.

(b) Range-compressed data with useful signal focused at the right location and nadir echo focused at different ranges within the synthetic aperture.

sim_matrix summary: : NADIR ECHO REMOVAL IN SAR 3 Fig. In particular, the acquired raw data are focused using a filter “matched” to the nadir echo, so that the nadir echo can be removed with a negligible corruption of the useful signal, as the nadir echo is focused and located at specific ranges, while the useful signal is smeared. (c) Focused data with focused nadir echo and useful signal smeared in both range and azimuth. (c) Focused data with nadir echo smeared in both range and azimuth. in fact, the nadir echo is smeared in the SAR image obtained after focusing matched to the useful signal and, in some cases, the level of the smeared nadir echo signal can be much lower than that of the thermal noise.

text_rank summary: As far as the suppression of each range- ambiguous signal is concerned, this could be based on an adaptive threshold (based, e.g., on local contrast minimization) to be applied to the image obtained after focusing matched to that range-ambiguous signal.From the complex backscatter of a part of the image (i.e., the Lake Starnberg), it is possible to generate raw data as they would have been acquired by an SAR system characterized by the parameters of Table I, both without and with waveform diversity, and focus them, obtaining the “ambiguity-free” SAR image in Fig.Although the radar antenna is designed to limit the energy transmitted to and received from the nadir direction, due to the smaller range and the specific characteristics of the scattering process (specular reflection), the nadir echo may be even stronger than the desired one and may, therefore, significantly affect the quality of the SAR image.(b) Range-compressed data with nadir echo focused at the right location and useful signal focused at different ranges within the synthetic aperture.(b) Range-compressed data with useful signal focused at the right location and nadir echo focused at different ranges within the synthetic aperture.

Title: The road to functional recovery : temporal effects of matrix regeneration on Amazonian bats
Word count: 1960
Abstract: Across the tropics, vast deforested areas are undergoing forest regeneration due to land abandonment. Although secondary forest is an expanding type of landscape matrix that has been shown to buffer some of the negative consequences of forest loss and fragmentation on taxonomic diversity, little is known in this regard about the functional dimension of biodiversity. We took advantage of an ecosystem-wide fragmentation experiment to investigate longer term changes in functional diversity of a mega-diverse Amazonian bat assemblage associated with regrowth development in the matrix. We found that matrix regeneration affected several facets of bat functional diversity in secondary forest over time, increasing functional α diversity, species- and community-level functional uniqueness, altering functional trait composition, and resulting in functional β-diversity changes via trait gains. However, approximately 30 years of matrix regeneration were insufficient for functional diversity to recover to the same levels as in continuous forest. Our results suggest that a combination of natural, human-assisted, and active restoration is likely to be the most successful strategy for restoring functional biodiversity of bats in human-modified tropical landscapes, a finding that most likely also applies to many other taxa

basic summary: Functional recovery of Amazonian bat assemblages following secondary forest succession. But how long does it take for bat assemblages in sec- ondary forest to attain levels of functional diversity as in continuous forest? However, approximately 30 years of matrix regeneration were insufficient for functional diversity to recover to the same levels as in continuous forest. Secondary forest regeneration benefits old-growth spe- cialist bats in a fragmented tropical landscape. Ways by which Neotropical frugivorous and gleaning animalivorous bats contribute to natural secondary forest regeneration. In this sense, our findings suggest that the sole reliance on restoring fully functional bat assemblages via natural regeneration is unlikely to be the most effective strategy.

Although a recent pantropical meta-analysis (Crouzeilles et al., 2017) found that natural regeneration trumps active restoration in achieving forest restoration success for a number of taxonomic groups, we concur with the authors’ conclusion that mixing both restoration approaches seems key to increasing species richness, and we contend the same applies to the recovery of functional diversity. The authors further thank Oriol M. Valeriano for preparing the illustrations used in Figure 2. Conservation strategies in tropical dis- turbed landscapes should, in addition to ensuring the preservation of large areas of primary forest, promote the regeneration and long-term protection of secondary forests regardless of their age.
