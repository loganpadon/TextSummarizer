Title: Making family: the journey into exile of a South Sudan refugee - part 2 #LSEreturn
Word count: 1695
Similarity: 0.9115902
Abstract: Through the story of Chol, LSE’s Naomi Pendle explores the meaning of exile and the lived experience of being a refugee through cycles of displacement and return. In the first article of this two-part series, Pendle tells us how Chol rebuilt home after years spent in exile. Now, LSE’s Naomi Pendle narrates Chol’s return into exile, a journey that was in itself a return and cemented his ability to build a family
Basic summary: Now, LSE’s Naomi Pendle narrates Chol’s return into exile, a journey that was in itself a return and cemented his ability to build a family. It was these networks, as much as a journey to a safe space, that he sought to cement as safety for himself, his wife and his son. Yet, they knew that the journey would be fraught with dangers and force them to weave between government and rebel held territories.

Title: Young people are highly critical of Brexit and fear the insularity it could bring
Word count: 1070
Similarity: 0.71269935
Abstract: Most young people did not support Brexit and the referendum result left many feeling frustrated and disempowered, write Shakuntala Banaji and Sam Mejias (LSE). They fear the vote will make the UK more insular and are highly critical of the way the campaign was conducted. In focus groups, they showed a strong understanding of the EU – and want a Brexit settlement that tackles inequality as well as ensuring Britain is an open and welcoming country
Basic summary: A minority of respondents asserted that the referendum and subsequent events had been a ‘participation catalyst’ for young people to become more politically active. As soon as people voted leave, there were attacks on minorities…I don’t know [if] people thought it was more OK to be racist, because they were leaving [the EU]. Secondly, young people expressed dissatisfaction that the oldest generations (65+) should have such a disproportionate influence on the futures of the youngest citizens.

Title: The political significance of Poland's government reshuffle
Word count: 1984
Similarity: 0.8639914
Abstract: A sweeping reshuffle by Poland's new prime minister has changed the shape and direction of its government, with a greater emphasis being placed on economic modernisation, political stabilisation and improving EU relations. But as Aleks Szczerbiak writes, this pivot to the technocratic centre risks alienating the ruling party's core electorate, and is more about packaging the government's reforms attractively than abandoning its its radical state re-construction programme
Basic summary: Most Law and Justice deputies support this, but in autumn 2016 large protests forced the ruling party to vote down a previous attempt to introduce greater restrictions. Cardiologist and deputy higher education minister Łukasz Szumowski took over as health minister from Konstanty Radziwiłł, who failed to resolve a high profile dispute involving resident doctors.

Title: What the 2015 Greek debt negotiations tell us about Germany's negotiating stance on Brexit
Word count: 1401
Similarity: 0.8134944
Abstract: If the UK wants to secure favourable terms during the Brexit negotiations, it will be crucial to win the support of Germany. But what are the key German priorities as the talks move on to the second phase? Luuk Molthof writes that the 2015 Greek debt negotiations offer some insights into the German approach, and that the UK is likely to be disappointed if it believes Germany will put economic interests above its political support for European integration
Basic summary: To understand why the British government would do well to heed these warnings, it is useful to be reminded of Germany’s role in the 2015 Greek bailout negotiations. The reason why Germany ultimately agreed to another bailout was because a Greek exit from the eurozone would undermine the euro’s credibility as an instrument of political integration. Yet in order to protect the euro’s role as a political instrument, Germany was willing to bear the economic costs.

Title: Quantity does matter as citation impact increases with productivity
Word count: 1040
Similarity: 0.6381179
Abstract: Many scholars are encouraged to focus on the quality not the quantity of their publications, the rationale being that becoming too focused on productivity risks reducing the quality of one's work. But is this, in fact, the case? Peter van den Besselaar and Ulf Sandström have studied a large sample of researchers and found that, while results vary by field, there is a positive and stronger than linear relationship between productivity and quality (in terms of the top cited papers). This same pattern appears to apply to institutions as well as individual researchers
Basic summary: Figure 3: Relationship between number of papers per university and impact in terms of Top10% papers. For each researcher we calculated the (field-normalised and fractionally counted) total number of publications and also the number of those publications that figure in the (2.5%) highest cited papers. In the social sciences, the (slightly) “diminishing returns” pattern seems to dominate; whereas the “impact ceiling” pattern was found for computer science & mathematics and for the humanities. Higher numbers of papers do result in even higher numbers of top cited papers.

Title: Far right politics in Germany: from fascism to populism?
Word count: 1606
Similarity: 0.6545875
Abstract: The rise of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) was one of the major stories of the 2017 German elections. As Tomá\v Nociar and Jan Philipp Thomeczek write, there has been a tendency among some commentators to draw parallels between the AfD and extremist or fascist parties from Germany's past. They argue that this is both unhelpful and inaccurate, and that the AfD has far more in common with other ‘populist’ parties who have had success in recent European elections
Basic summary: LSE European Politics and Policy (EUROPP) Blog: Far right politics in Germany: From fascism to populism? This new type of populist radical right party either never developed or dropped the antidemocratic sentiment in favour of a populist critique of the establishment. It is the rise of a populist radical right that is successful precisely because of its populism and not because it embodies fascism or extremism.

Title: Who is helped by Help to Buy?
Word count: 1831
Similarity: 0.75586647
Abstract: What's not to like about a policy which can expand home ownership and boost the supply of housing? Geoff Meeks and J.Gay Meeks recount some of the doubts about the efficacy of the government's Help to Buy scheme. They present new evidence on some of its regressive distributional consequences, and touch on the opportunity cost of the subsidy programme
Basic summary: These are “equity loans”, which means the government’s stake in a participating house changes at the same rate with the value of the house. As house prices rise, the argument goes, the government achieves capital gains, which offset the interest costs of servicing the debt which funds H2B. So the new house will be much the better buy, and it will be worth her while to pay more for the new than for the second- hand house.

Title: We don't know how democracies die
Word count: 1262
Similarity: 0.8977461
Abstract: Since the election of Donald Trump, many have expressed their concern that the United States could slip into an authoritarian backslide. Emily Holland and Hadas Aron react to this claim, most notably asserted in Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt's new book, 'How Democracies Die,' noting that the decline of one of the most stable, long-lasting democracies in the world can only be compared to the decline of other lasting, consolidated democracies, of which there are none
Basic summary: The countries that are most vulnerable to populist democratic decline are simply those that are most vulnerable to democratic decline in general. Here lies the great danger of the populist turn: the battleground is vulnerable democracies, and the United States is consciously neglecting its role as a defender of democracy.

Title: The hidden costs of research assessment exercises: the curious case of Australia
Word count: 1309
Similarity: 0.93877876
Abstract: Research assessment exercises provide the government and wider public with assurance of the quality of university research, with the guiding principles being accountability, transparency, and openness. But is there the same accountability and openness when it comes to the public cost of these large-scale exercises? Ksenia Sawczak examines the situation in Australia as the research sector looks ahead to the new Engagement and Impact Assessment later this year. There seems little doubt this exercise will demand significant resources, with no guarantee it will achieve its stated goal of improving how universities engage with industry. Until the hidden costs of assessment exercises are revealed and a thorough consideration of their general utility is undertaken, questions will remain as to whether they are a responsible use of public monies
Basic summary: There seems little doubt this exercise will demand significant resources, with no guarantee it will achieve its stated goal of improving how universities engage with industry. What is curious about Australia is that ERA functions in a vacuum, conducted by government but playing no role in informing federal research policy or funding allocations to universities. The authors of the NISA boldly stated that an exercise of this kind will ultimately lead to improvements in how universities engage with industry. Ksenia Sawczak examines the situation in Australia as the research sector looks ahead to the new Engagement and Impact Assessment later this year. About the author Ksenia Sawczak is Director of Research Services at the University of Canberra, where she oversees the preparation of data submissions to government agencies.

Title: Looming REF deadlines lead to a rush in publication of lower quality research
Word count: 1280
Similarity: 0.86643785
Abstract: The increased significance of research assessments and their implications for funding and career prospects has had a knock-on effect on academic publication patterns. Moqi Groen-Xu, Pedro A. Teixeira, Thomas Voigt and Bernhard Knapp report on research that reveals a marked increase in research productivity immediately prior to an evaluation deadline, which quickly reverses once the deadline has passed. Moreoever, the quality of papers published just before deadlines is lower, as measured by citations. Those who design research assessments should consider having cycles of varying lengths across different fields, affording researchers the time and opportunity to pursue more novel, risky projects
Basic summary: Our research indicates that research output does indeed change around the time researchers are submitted to assessment exercises. Those who design research assessments should consider having cycles of varying lengths across different fields, affording researchers the time and opportunity to pursue more novel, risky projects. After our research was reported on the Times Higher Education, Steven Hill – Head of Research Policy at HEFCE – raised concerns about our interpretation of the findings. Because older papers had more time to accumulate citations, information about them is more precise at that time, thus biasing the choice of older articles with higher citation counts.

Title: The UK government is shedding some of its illusions about Brexit, and softening its position
Word count: 1040
Similarity: 0.549643
Abstract: Step by step, the UK government is shedding some of its illusions about Brexit, argues Holger Schmieding (Berenberg). The United Kingdom has already accepted that it will have to meet the legally binding financial commitments it incurred while it was a member of the European Union (the so-called Brexit bill) and is going along with the EU's timetable for negotiations (divorce issues first, transition deal next, outlines of a future trade deal last). Last Friday saw another set of concessions being made by the Prime Minister
Basic summary: Under such a deal, the UK would maintain access to the EU’s single market for goods and for some services on almost the same preferential terms as before. The only practical way in which Brexit could be reversed would be if early new elections swept a Labour-led government to power that might possibly call a new referendum. However, Theresa May is not yet close to such a deal that would minimise the economic damage to the UK.

Basic summary: The rules-based global trade regime, which constituted an anchor of stability for the world economy since the end of World War II, would cease to exist. The looming WTO case has the potential to do significant long-term damage to the global trade regime and world economy. The risk of tariff retaliations spiralling out of control The surge in US protectionism constitutes a serious challenge to the global trade regime.

Abstract: Could the consequences of automation lead to the growth of communism, as Mark Carney has warned? Mathew Lawrence writes that deep technological change opens up two divergent paths: one where technologies are managed and owned to our collective advancement against one where they deepen inequalities. He draws on IPPR research to outline three strategies that will ensure automation works for the common good
Basic summary: Managed well, automation could build a future of shared economic plenty, the productivity gains of technological change allowing us all to live better and more freely. Mathew Lawrence writes that deep technological change opens up two divergent paths: one where technologies are managed and owned to our collective advancement against one where they deepen inequalities. To address this, the more rapid adoption of digital technologies, including automation, should become one of the national ‘missions’ of the government’s industrial strategy.

Abstract: How does it feel to be a Polish national in Scotland after the EU referendum? Kate Botterill (Edinburgh Napier University) discusses how the result and subsequent uncertainty affected them, and the strategies they have adopted to deal with it. Post-Brexit, the Scottish Government want a different approach to migration from the rest of the UK, which may lead to stronger identification with Scotland among many Poles living in the country. Nonetheless, Scottish public attitudes towards migration appear to be hardening
Basic summary: So even though so many people voted to remain, I’m looking at the streets and I feel anger and I feel hatred… And I have an accent. Given these challenges, will changing Scotland’s narrative on migration be enough to make EU citizens feel at home? This research raises key questions about how Polish nationals are negotiating belonging in Scotland through broader affiliations with Europe, and often away from Poland. When it comes to migration, Scotland is widely considered to be on a different political journey to the rest of the UK.

Title: The crisis in social care is connected to the gendered inadequacy of labour law
Word count: 1218
Similarity: 0.9371537
Abstract: Lydia Hayes writes that social care is a feminist issue. Highlighting some of the appalling conditions that care workers tolerate, she explains how employment law fails to protect women's employment and to value feminised labour. She concludes that unless social care provision is revolutionised, women will have little choice but to serve as unpaid carers: stuck at home, excluded from public life, and denied life choices
Basic summary: Until the wages of care workers are free from sexist devaluation, and until the work of care workers is fully recognised, the labour of all women is devalued. The inadequacy of minimum wage law The financial crisis of 2007/2008 heralded UK labour market changes in which care work became the largest source of low-waged work for women. Care workers are failed by the current right to a minimum wage where their work is not recognised as ‘work’ for the purposes of statutory pay protection.

Title: High prices, not waste or over-use, drive high health care costs in the US
Word count: 881
Similarity: 0.70072037
Abstract: The US spends nearly 18 percent of its GDP on health care, making it a real outlier among high-income countries in this area. But what is behind this unusually high level of health care spending? Irene Papanicolas investigates common beliefs about why spending is so high, including that US residents use more health care services, have poorer quality of care, and use 'too much' inpatient care. She finds that higher costs in the US are largely driven by higher prices across a wide range of health care services such as surgical procedures and drugs, as well as administrative complexity and costs
Basic summary: The data suggest two main factors drive health care spending in the US: higher prices across a wide range of health care services and administrative complexity and costs. Evidence: The US has among the lowest proportion of health care spending on inpatient services (19 percent) and among the highest for outpatient services (42 percent). While low social spending may contribute to poorer population health outcomes, it is unlikely a primary driver of higher health care spending. Belief 1: The US spends more than other countries because US residents consume much more health care services.

Title: How we can preserve assisted housing in the context of gentrification and constrained federal resources
Word count: 1239
Similarity: 0.82639015
Abstract: Like many American cities, Washington DC is experiencing a squeeze in its affordable housing: population increases and declining stocks of government subsidized housing are making it harder for low-income households to find somewhere to live. In new research, Kathryn Howell looks at how existing assisted housing in Washington, DC is being preserved in the face of gentrification and funding challenges. She writes that preservation is a long and complex process that engages diverse stakeholders from tenants and tenant organizers to local and federal agency staff
Basic summary: This case offers powerful support for increased collaboration between stakeholders and meaningful local laws and flexible funding for the preservation of affordable housing. But developing new funding sources and programs for the complex process of preservation requires multiple private and government stakeholders, shared governance and access to data. She writes that preservation is a long and complex process that engages diverse stakeholders from tenants and tenant organizers to local and federal agency staff.

Word count: 1221
Similarity: 0.7397646
Abstract: In Colonial Captivity during the First World War: Internment and the Fall of the German Empire, 1914-1919, Mahon Murphy offers a comprehensive study of the experiences of the 20,000 Germans in colonies who spent in time in Allied captivity during World War One. This is an impressive analysis that uses internment as a prism to examine the War’s extra-European theatres, underscoring the conflict’s global dimensions and critically examining imperial notions of race, writes Joshua Smeltzer
Basic summary: Indeed, Murphy’s narrative firmly establishes an interconnected web of camps, implicated in imperial notions of race and shaped by a common European civilising mission. At the outbreak of World War One, the British swiftly repatriated Germans from Cameroon and Togo, while transferring combatants and males of military age to camps in Britain.

Title: Book review: a lab of one's own: science and suffrage in the First World War by Patricia Fara
Word count: 1683
Similarity: 0.8852106
Abstract: In A Lab of One's Own: Science and Suffrage in the First World War, Patricia Fara follows the trajectories of women scientists during World War One, describing their struggles in academia and laboratories in tandem with the battle for the vote and the war unfolding across various fronts. Cléo Chassonnery-Zaïgouche praises the book for its complex and nuanced account of the changing status of women scientists in the early twentieth century
Basic summary: Networks of women play a central role in the history of women’s education and work, from suffrage to upper-middle-class women’s philanthropic connections. First, Fara gives us some hints of changing views on women, but does not discuss the development of knowledge produced by women in the social sciences.

Title: How is Oxfam being held accountable over the Haiti scandal?
Word count: 1179
Similarity: 0.7685419
Abstract: The recent allegations against Oxfam employees in Haiti sparked a series of reports about misconduct within major charities, which in turn raised serious questions about accountability in the NGO sector. Domenico Carolei looks at whether the systems of accountability that apply to British NGOs and charities working in poor countries are adequate and comprehensive
Basic summary: Intra-organisational accountability An internal dimension of the accountability process takes place at the organisational level among staff involved in the charity’s governance and administration. Institutional watchdogs and regulatory bodies may exercise a significant degree of accountability over charities by granting or revoking charity status, and by issuing disciplinary sanctions in cases of misconduct.

Title: A coercive policy-making state? How the EU is alienating its citizens
Word count: 1284
Similarity: 0.8618265
Abstract: The remit of EU institutions has expanded inexorably, writes Jeremy Richardson, all while their policy-making style has shifted from a consensus-based process towards a more coercive, top-down one. At the same time, the EU's focus on interest groups might have also exacerbated the problem of the democratic deficit by distancing the EU from broader public opinion. These realities have contributed to both Brexit and the broader 'populist revolt' across Member States
Basic summary: At the same time, the EU’s focus on interest groups might have also exacerbated the problem of the democratic deficit by distancing the EU from broader public opinion. The shift in focus from the national to the EU level by interest groups might have exacerbated the problem of the democratic deficit. Many groups, such as women’s and environmental groups concluded that they would gain more policy concessions at the European level.

Abstract: In response to Professor Sanjib Baruah's article 'Stateless in Assam' which discussed a new focus on detention camps for 'stateless citizens', Suraj Gogoi, Gorky Chakraborty and Parag Jyoti Saikia reflect on the implications of reducing people to 'bare life'
Basic summary: It has thus created a ‘state of exception’ in a space which itself is a ‘state of exception’ to the Indian state.

Title: How will Brexit affect the social security rights of EU migrants in the UK, and how the social protection of EU staff?
Word count: 1410
Similarity: 0.8540291
Abstract: Linda Hantrais focuses on two ways in which social security provisions may be affected by Brexit: the social security rights of EU migrants to the UK, where EU institutions have come to play an important coordinating role; and, the social protection rights of British officials working for EU institutions, where benefits and employers' contributions are paid from the EU administrative budget to which the UK contributes
Basic summary: In the European Pillar of Social Rights, Juncker set out his strategy for achieving ‘upward convergence’ between EU Member States with ‘social protection as a productive factor’.

Title: Critical actors and abortion law: a group of individuals in Northern Irish politics obstructs change
Word count: 965
Similarity: 0.7582675
Abstract: There are various reasons why progress on legal abortion in Northern Ireland has been blocked over the years. Key among them is that individual politicians rule out any suggestion of change, writes Jennifer Thomson. She argues that more attention should be given to the actions of individual actors, considering their role can often be as important as that of political parties or institutions
Basic summary: Feminist political scientists have long employed the concept of ‘critical actors’ to refer to key individuals who instigate positive change within political institutions. Attempts to change abortion policy at the moment are also not helped by the fact that Northern Ireland is facing one of its most challenging political periods in decades. When considering why some policies are difficult to change, or even to implement at all, consideration must be given to the actions of individual members of political institutions.

Title: The origins of city centrism: 'the potential of Glasgow city centre'
Word count: 1065
Similarity: 0.84119046
Abstract: Andy Pike analyses some of the themes in the 1983 report 'The Potential of Glasgow City Centre', an early example of city centrism with a policy repertoire that has since influenced urban and regional development thinking. He explains why, 35 years on, city centrism presents more of a mixed picture than a panacea for urban policy; in a separate post he offers thoughts on the way forward
Basic summary: City policies – such as spatial planning, city centre regeneration, investment attraction, innovation, and skills – have supported structural evolution towards services. A central city focus upon the needs and dynamism of the urban core as the “natural location” for most business and many consumer services.

Title: The limits of city centrism? We need to rethink how we approach urban and regional development
Word count: 1257
Similarity: 0.9286104
Abstract: Following on from his previous analysis on why city centrism has not turned out to be a panacea for urban development so far, Andy Pike argues it is time for fresh thinking. He explains why we need to find better ways to think about and design policies that support the combination of the dynamism of Britain's city centres
Basic summary: High skilled employment and agglomeration are necessary but not sufficient for city growth On city skills, city growth and high-skilled occupations are closely related. But the city centrism propositions of ‘smart cities becoming smarter’, and a positive relationship between agglomeration and high skilled employment growth do not appear to apply to British cities.

Abstract: Literacy and socio-economic indicators of Balochistan province in Pakistan are a grave reminder of the state of poverty in the region. Asmat Kakar draws from his personal experience of growing up in the region and writes that only education can level the playing field and provide socio-economic development
Basic summary: According to the Ministry of Education report Pakistan Education Statistics 2015-16, Balochistan is on top of the list, with an alarming 70 per cent children out of school. It states that more than 70 per cent and around 85 per cent people in rural areas of Balochistan province are living in multidimensional poverty.

Title: In Congressional races, political networks play an important role in ensuring minority representation
Word count: 1198
Similarity: 0.7852882
Abstract: A number of retirements in Congress ahead of the 2018 midterms have opened up the possibility for increased Latino representation in the US House of Representatives. But, the past has shown that Latino candidates aren't always selected for, or win elections in, majority Latino districts and that Latinos and non-Latinos who are elected don't always represent the views of their constituents. In new research, Angela X. Ocampo finds that political networks have a large influence on whether a Latino or non-Latino gets onto the ballot as a candidate. These networks are also often able to push candidates forward based on their legislative priorities, which may or may not align with the preferences of their constituents
Basic summary: This article is based on the paper The Wielding Influence of Political Networks: Representation in Majority- Latino Districts in Political Research Quarterly (PRQ). Lastly, the evidence showed that lack of coordination and fragmentation among existent political networks paved the way for the emergence of non-Latino candidates in majority-Latino districts. Political networks were also critical in narrowing down candidate fields when announced Latino and non-Latino candidates might weaken the chances of one another. The dataset included vote turns, candidate and district demographics and financial contributions made by the candidates themselves, individuals, parties and groups.

Title: The rhetorical attacks against the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School illustrate the breakdown of civil discourse in US politics
Word count: 1231
Similarity: 0.93901837
Abstract: In the wake of the tragic shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida on February 14th, many of the school's students have pushed hard for more stringent gun control legislation, only to be met with vitriolic attacks from the right, often accusing them of being 'crisis actors'. Ben Margulies writes that the treatment of these students echoes the way whites treat non-white political opponents: often as ‘enemies’ or ‘aliens’ who are unworthy of civil discourse
Basic summary: Ben Margulies writes that the treatment of these students echoes the way whites treat non-white political opponents: often as ‘enemies’ or ‘aliens’ who are unworthy of civil discourse. There is little new to say about the United States’ unique gun culture, or about the grievous impact that this culture has on public safety in the country.

Title: Where are Kampala's missing houses?
Word count: 1040
Similarity: 0.9701059
Abstract: Kampala is facing a dearth of affordable formal housing. Rural-urban migration, limited access to mortgage finance, and a host of other factors are all straining its housing sector. It is imperative for planners to think of innovative and sustainable ways to address this issue, argue Astrid Haas and Thierry Hoza Ngoga
Basic summary: Land tenure and housing finance are only two of the reasons driving the housing gap in the city. Slums and land tenure As a result of lack of access to formal housing, Kampala has become home to a large number of slums. Furthermore, to keep pace with the urban growth of the city, it is estimated that the housing stock would have to increase by a further 29,000 units per year.

Abstract: Michael Kenny and Jack Sheldon write that, although May's government has been prepared to make various concessions in its dealings with the devolved governments, tricky intergovernmental negotiations relating to Brexit are in line. How these will be managed will be one of the most difficult aspects of the Brexit process
Basic summary: Its original draft would have prevented the devolved administrations from legislating in all areas currently covered by EU law until the long-term allocation of powers was agreed. In the scenario that no deal is reached, the Scottish and Welsh governments would seek to pass their ‘continuity bills’.

Title: EU students at UK universities: patterns and trends
Word count: 624
Similarity: 0.8895342
Abstract: What Brexit will mean for UK universities varies from institution to institution. Much data on Brexit's impact focuses on sector-wide aggregates, the forest that hides the trees. The UK provides excellent teaching and research, as illustrated by the number of its universities ranked in the top 10, 50 or 100 in the world. Yet despite its world-class reputation, the UK's higher education sector is hierarchical, and various layers will be affected differently. Ludovic Highman (UCL) explores the sector’s diversity in this regard
Basic summary: Currently they are treated as home students, but in all likelihood EU students enrolling in the UK after its withdrawal in March 2019 will be treated as overseas students. The diversity of the student fabric of UK universities, so crucial to the overall student experience, depends on a healthy number of non-UK based students interacting with domestic students. Scottish universities are attractive to non-UK EU students in absolute numbers, with Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen attracting more than Oxbridge and competing with the top London universities. EU students graduate from rigorous secondary school systems and their drive to study abroad, most often in a language that is not theirs, makes them attractive to UK universities. It is possible that higher concentrations of EU students will further relocate to Scotland, though this depends on the level of fees charged beyond 2020.

Title: Book review: war in 140 characters: how social media is reshaping conflict in the twenty-first century by David Patrikarakos
Word count: 1057
Similarity: 0.9535033
Abstract: In War in 140 Characters: How Social Media is Reshaping Conflict in the Twenty-First Century, David Patrikarakos explores how social media is shifting the power balance from governments and institutions towards individuals and networks and the impact this is having on contemporary warfare. Relating the personal stories of individuals caught up in conflict, this book underscores the centrality of narratives and storytelling to understanding the changing face of war today, writes Madeline McSherry
Basic summary: These individuals and their stories are on the frontlines of his new book, War in 140 Characters: How Social Media is Reshaping Conflict in the Twenty-First Century. Nowhere is this transfer of power more evident than in the story of Eliot Higgins, the obsessive online gamer whose social media investigation challenged a global superpower.

Similarity: 0.8984234
Abstract: In How to be a Geek: Essays on the Culture of Software, Matthew Fuller explores the bits and bytes that have reshaped our world through a collection of essays that examines the figure of the geek and software cultures. While the lack of cohesive thread and use of terminology means this collection is best suited to scholars already familiar with the field rather than newcomers, the book contains some useful and astute insights, writes Wendy Liu
Basic summary: Overall, How To Be a Geek is a useful addition to the field of software studies, geared primarily toward academics who are already enmeshed in the field. This is the scene onto which Matthew Fuller’s How To Be a Geek: Essays on the Culture of Software has emerged.

Title: Book review: the Rohingyas: inside Myanmar's genocide by Azeem Ibrahim
Word count: 1275
Similarity: 0.931575
Abstract: This updated edition of The Rohingyas: Inside Myanmar’s Genocide, authored by Azeem Ibrahim, aims to draw further attention to the ongoing atrocities being committed against the Rohingyas in Myanmar and to challenge some of the overarching myths that lie behind the persecutions. While she would have welcomed a deeper engagement with the legal components of the situation from the perspective of international law, Ebru Demir recommends this as a welcome contribution to the literature that will give readers insight into the historical roots of the crisis
Basic summary: Find this book: The publication of an updated version of Azeem Ibrahim’s book, The Rohingyas: Inside Myanmar’s Genocide, is very timely considering the current situation in Myanmar. Yet, having read Ibrahim’s book, this seems unlikely to address the root causes of the situation and to guarantee non-repetition for the victims.

Abstract: Following months of coalition negotiations, a new German government has finally taken office. But what does the new government mean for the EU? Alessandra Pozzi Rocco writes that with her next term in power now secured, Merkel has the chance to craft EU history further, notably by forging ahead on common defence and security
Basic summary: What Germany’s grand coalition means for European defence and security Following months of coalition negotiations, a new German government has finally taken office. Starting off on the right foot, there is great potential for advancement in the field of security and defence policy. There is a good reason to believe Berlin will take more decisive steps out of necessity, but with an even-handed approach with regards to defence, development and cooperation.

Title: Finding a way out of the Catalan labyrinth
Word count: 1496
Similarity: 0.82849616
Abstract: Almost four months after regional elections, Catalonia still has no government, and there is no end in sight in the stand-off over Catalan independence. Astrid Barrio and Bonnie N. Field write that there remain major international and judicial impediments to forming a new government, as well as notable splits in opinion within the pro-independence movement on the best strategy to pursue. And with political actors reaching an impasse, street protests and direct action initiatives have started to fill the vacuum
Basic summary: What’s more, Spain’s government does not consider a hypothetical government, led by Puigdemont from afar, to be an effective government. That debate was urgently convened when the court ordered Turull, other accused members of the former government, and former parliamentary speaker Carme Forcadell to appear in court. The Catalan independence movement has seized upon this to again propose Sánchez’s candidacy, pending a court ruling, with the investiture debate set for 13 April.

Title: The more revisions a paper undergoes, the greater its subsequent recognition in terms of citations
Word count: 1257
Similarity: 0.8667737
Abstract: Is the peer review process simply a means by which errors are identified and corrected? Or is it a process in which a more constructive dialogue can take place and reviewers and editors may actively contribute to the text? John Rigby, Deborah Cox and Keith Julian have studied the published articles of a social sciences journal and found that the more revisions a paper undergoes, the greater its subsequent recognition in terms of citations
Basic summary: Peer review needs to be recognised not as an event but as a process, often a long one, and one in which a constructive dialogue can take place. Our paper is part of a long-running effort to open the “black box” of peer review. Our work throws up an interesting paradox – at least an interesting paradox for those who hold that peer review is error correction.

Title: It's not enough for research to be useful to policy actors, we must try to actually influence change
Word count: 1544
Similarity: 0.7906436
Abstract: There is no doubt that good communications and framing research and evidence for your audience is important to influencing policy and having research impact. But shouldn't we be aiming higher than producing and packaging research that simply meets the demands of policy actors? Surely what we actually want to do is influence change, not reinforce social and political norms? James Georgalakis argues that research and researchers need to challenge dominant paradigms and expose inconvenient truths. Relationships, networks, and bodies of knowledge play a far more significant role in change processes than short-term communications campaigns on specific research reports
Basic summary: The first is the simple one favoured by research donors and think tanks that says that research, if packaged correctly, can directly “enlighten” policy actors. We try and overcome academics’ nervousness about policy engagement by demonstrating that research rigour and policy engagement can be mutually reinforcing. However, another model describes how by trying to shape research and evidence for policy we may actually allow politics to shape knowledge. Academics’ anxiety over engaging in policy, which can sometimes seem very inconvenient, centres less on the issue of measurement and more on the fundamental relationship between evidence and policy. The semi-professional disciplines of both policy influence and research impact always attract the communications crowd.

Title: We need more carrots: give academic researchers the support and incentives to share data
Word count: 1120
Similarity: 0.9664719
Abstract: Making data available for other researchers to find, use, reuse, and reproduce is fundamental to open science, and ultimately makes research more efficient and effective. Yet despite funder policies that encourage and require data sharing, researchers in both the UK and the US report lower percentages of data sharing than the global average. In addition to progressive policies, Grace Baynes suggests researchers should be given incentives, expert support, training, and the infrastructure to make it seamless and easy to share data, and worth their while. Governments, funders, research institutions, libraries, and publishers all have a role to play to unlock the huge potential of research data
Basic summary: Yet despite funder policies that encourage and require data sharing, researchers in both the UK and the US report lower percentages of data sharing than the global average. Our findings, Practical Challenges for Researchers in Data Sharing, are openly accessible in Figshare along with the survey data. While sharing data as supplementary information is better than not sharing data at all, it is a sub-optimal solution. Initiatives such as DataCite and the Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles help make research data more citable and discoverable.

Title: The neurotic academic: how anxiety fuels casualised academic work
Word count: 1380
Similarity: 0.7158483
Abstract: As higher education undergoes a process of marketisation in the UK and the activities of academic staff are increasingly measured and scrutinised, universities are suffused with anxiety. Coupled with pressures facing all staff, casualised academics face multiple forms of insecurity. While anxiety is often perceived as an individual problem for which employees are encouraged to take personal responsibility, Vik Loveday argues that anxiety amongst academic staff should be understood in two ways: as a symptom of casualised work in an increasingly competitive environment; and as a tactic of governance, ensuring compliance
Basic summary: This blog post is based on the author’s article, “The neurotic academic: anxiety, casualisation, and governance in the neoliberalising university”, published in the Journal of Cultural Economy (DOI: 10.1080/17530350.2018.1426032). Anxiety, then, can be conceptualised as a kind of “tactic” of governance: fuelling hard work, a striving for so-called “excellence”, and the creation of obedient academic subjects. It will come as no surprise to those working in the UK’s higher education (HE) sector that universities are currently suffused with anxiety.

Title: PhD students supervised collectively rather than individually are quicker to complete their theses
Word count: 1366
Similarity: 0.8388211
Abstract: Given the choice, most PhD students would prefer to receive individual supervision rather than be supervised alongside their peers as part of a collective. This is understandable, given the undivided attention and precise, directly relevant advice one would receive. However, Hans Agné and Ulf Mörkenstam have compared the experiences of individually and collectively supervised students on the same doctoral programme and found that collective supervision, during the first year at least, is correlated with significantly shorter times to thesis completion compared to individual supervision
Basic summary: Studied in this way, it appears that collective supervision of first-year doctoral students is correlated with significantly shorter times to thesis completion compared to individual supervision. Students who received collective supervision in the first year averaged 57 months in the programme, while students receiving individual supervision averaged 92 months. Multivariate statistical analyses of these observations support the conclusion that collective supervision in the first year does indeed reduce the time to completion of doctoral students.

Word count: 1339
Similarity: 0.8671062
Abstract: In Deconstructing Dirty Dancing, Stephen Lee Naish unpacks the enduring popularity of the film Dirty Dancing, released to mixed reviews in 1987 before going on to become a global hit. Offering a comparative study of the film with David Lynch’s Blue Velvet before a scene-by-scene analysis and reflections on the film’s personal resonance for the author, the book is an idiosyncratic and accessible take on this cultural phenomenon, finds Penny Montague
Basic summary: The essay is an absorbing account of his uneven relationship with the film, which will resonate with a wide range of readers, whether fans of the film or otherwise. Throughout this section of the book, Naish analyses and illuminates each moment of the film, its dialogue, music, wardrobe, plot and themes, particularly drawing out its political threads.

Title: Svexit or Huxit? How another country could follow the UK out of the EU
Word count: 1656
Similarity: 0.9116753
Abstract: What are the chances of another country following the UK out of the EU? Eurosceptics in other states may be emboldened by the deal the UK manages to secure, especially if it includes access to the Single Market. Moves to further EU integration could have a similar effect. Simon Hix (LSE) and Nick Sitter (Central European University) look at the cases of Hungary and Sweden
Basic summary: A scenario that would see Sweden as the next country to leave the EU would have to involve a substantial change in the cross-party political consensus on European integration. The most realistic basis for such a scenario would involve the emergence of a model of European integration that is more attractive for Sweden than full EU membership. Should Brexit lead to a new model that is more attractive than the EEA, the benefits of EU membership might seem less obvious. Second, a successful soft Brexit could conceivably provide an attractive alternative to full EU membership.

Title: Book review: fire and fury: inside the Trump White House by Michael Wolff
Word count: 1486
Similarity: 0.9260745
Abstract: With the overnight international bestseller Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, Michael Wolff utilises his ‘semipermanent seat’ on a West Wing sofa to offer an insider account of the Trump administration. While critical of Wolff’s writing style, methods and failure to separate clear falsehoods from certainties, Jonny Hall concedes that the book remains a gripping read that is at its most revealing when discussing the warring factions shaping Trump’s Presidency
Basic summary: In sum, I would contend that this book is slightly more accurate than is generally being portrayed, but Wolff’s methods and writing style hardly aid his cause. This is one of the grievances of what Wolff or Trump might call the ‘mainstream media’: that Wolff’s book is simply ‘gossip’, and that ‘gossip isn’t journalism’.

Title: Metrics Mania: The Case Against Academia.edu
Word count: 1423
Similarity: 0.8891735
Abstract: Academia.edu has been called "Facebook for academics," and the analogy is fitting: Academia.edu mimics core social-media conventions, down to follower counts, curated profiles with pics, and a scrollable "News Feed" bulletin of followers’ uploads. But its reliance on user-facing metrics exceeds anything you’ll find on mainstream social media. It comes with a dedicated "Analytics" page resembling a gaming leaderboard or a corporation’s annual report. The charts and graphs encourage incessant monitoring, which dovetails with university policies that seek to measure quantifiable "impact." The result? Scholars are internalizing an analytics mind-set
Basic summary: Scholars upload their paywalled papers, which become Google-indexed PDFs; the company uses these to draw in new members; the audience increases, prompting more scholars to upload their work. t most universities, annual evaluations and tenure decisions hinge on numbers: article counts, journal impact factors, h-index scores, and, perhaps, standardized teaching evaluations. This essay is based on an article, written with Brooke Erin Duffy, an assistant professor of communication at Cornell University, that recently appeared in Social Media + Society. With the audit culture lodged inside us, we don’t even need a warped incentive structure to overproduce papers and game the numbers. But now Academia.edu invites us to measure ourselves — to incorporate page views and download counts into our intellectual identities. "Academia is the easiest way to share papers with millions of people across the world for free," proclaims the site.

Title: Extending Internet to Powerless Areas
Word count: 2899
Similarity: 0.8117929
Abstract: Literature ReviewThe lack of internet in undeveloped countries and other rural areas is detrimental to the development of the area. Access to internet can have many profound effects on developing countries such as creating economic opportunities for small and medium sized businesses (Meltzer) and improving education (Purdue). In many of these rural areas and developing countries, such as Africa, children do not have up to date education (The Economist), people struggle to find jobs (ACET), and the infrastructure is lacking (The World Bank). The lack of internet in areas that have been affected by natural disasters is also a large problem that our society faces. Areas where the cellular towers and power generators were knocked out would benefit greatly from connectivity because it would allow the affected community to communicate with outside help.  One example of when internet needed to be extended to an area affected by disaster is Puerto Rico after Hurricane Irma knocked out over 90% of their cell service (Fiegerman). Some companies have attempted to create solar powered wi-fi hotspots, but none of them are implemented in the way that we plan to solve the problem. No product exists that can provide internet without cellular coverage nor a power grid. However, there are a couple of products that are in our area of research. The company Soluxio has created a solar powered wi-fi extender/LTE wi-fi hotspot. This is primarily for creating outdoor wi-fi networks in places with an existing internet connection or for resorts and city parks in developed areas where LTE data is available (Soluxio). The company Moja has created a microserver that also connects to LTE data. This device has the option to be solar powered, but it also has the same limitation as the Soluxio device in that it relies on LTE data which does not cover a large portion of the globe (Moja). Thesis Statement Design a system/device that can provide internet to areas that do not have reliable power or cellular coverage

That is why we have taken on the task to design a system/device that can provide internet to areas that do not have reliable power or cellular coverage. There are many areas in the world that do not have or have very sparse internet connections; some areas may even lack reliable power. Thesis Statement Design a system/device that can provide internet to areas that do not have reliable power or cellular coverage. Solar Panel Roof Mount The roof mount design is less expensive than the pole mount design, however it can only be used in areas with the proper infrastructure. Since many use cases for our device involves disaster relief areas, the device also needs to be able to withstand very rough climates and weather conditions. Our system is capable of producing its own power and sustaining itself and even 14 some excess power to the client. Since most of the Puerto Ricans do not have power or lights still, it would be imperative to have some sort of power source functionality. Areas where the cellular towers and power generators were knocked out would benefit greatly from connectivity because it would allow the affected community to communicate with outside help. No product exists that can provide 2 internet without cellular coverage nor a power grid.

Abstract: The essays in this interdisciplinary volume explore language, broadly construed, as part of the continued interrogation of the boundaries of human and nonhuman animals in the Middle Ages. Uniting a diverse set of emerging and established scholars, Animal Languages questions the assumed medieval distinction between humans and other animals. The chapters point to the wealth of non-human communicative and discursive forms through which animals function both as vehicles for human meaning and as agents of their own, demonstrating the significance of human and non-human interaction in medieval texts, particularly for engaging with the Other. The book ultimately considers the ramifications of deconstructing the medieval anthropocentric view of language for the broader question of human singularity

Title: Assessment of expression of interferon γ (IFN-G) gene and its antisense (IFNG-AS1) in breast cancer
Word count: 3148
Similarity: 0.85473794
Abstract: Background  The role of long non-coding RNAs has been extensively appreciated in the contexts of cancer. Interferon γ-antisense RNA1 (IFNG-AS1) is an lncRNA located near to IFN-γ-encoding (IFNG) gene and regulates expression of IFNG in Th1 cells. Methods  In the present study, we evaluated expression of IFNG and IFNG-AS1 in 108 breast samples including tumoral tissues and their adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANCTs) using real-time PCR. IFNG-AS1 was significantly upregulated in tumoral tissues compared with ANCTs (expression ratio = 2.23, P = 0.03). Results  Although the expression of IFNG was higher in tumoral tissues compared with ANCTs (relative expression = 1.89), it did not reach the level of significance (P = 0.07). IFNG expression was significantly higher in HER2-negative tumoral tissues compared with HER2-positive ones (P = 0.01) and in grade 1 samples compared with grade 2 ones (P = 0.03). No other significant difference was found in expressions of genes between other groups. Conclusion Significant strong correlations were detected between expression of IFNG and IFNG-AS1 in both tumoral tissues and ANCTs. The present study provides evidences for participation of IFNG and IFNG-AS1 in the pathogenesis of breast cancer and warrants future studies to elaborate the underlying mechanism
Basic summary: IFNG expression was significantly higher in HER2-negative tumoral tissues compared with HER2-positive ones (P = 0.01) and in grade 1 samples compared with grade 2 ones (P = 0.03). In spite of several efforts to evaluate the effi- ciency of IFN-γ treatment in breast cancer, data regarding expression of IFNG gene in breast cancer tissues is scarce. Methods: In the present study, we evaluated expression of IFNG and IFNG-AS1 in 108 breast samples including tumoral tissues and their adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANCTs) using real-time PCR. Results: Although the expression of IFNG was higher in tumoral tissues compared with ANCTs (relative expression = 1.89), it did not reach the level of significance (P = 0.07). Expression analysis Relative expressions of IFNG and IFNG-AS1 genes were assessed in tumoral tissues and paired ANCTs in the rotor gene 6000 Corbett Real-Time PCR System. Table 3 shows the results of association analysis between relative expressions of genes in tumoral tissues compared with ANCTs and patients’ clinicopath- ological data. Elevated expression of IFNG-AS1 lncRNA has been reported in Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT) patients in correlation with the proportion of circulating Th1 cells and IFNG gene expression . We compared expression level of IFNG and IFNG-AS1 in each tumoral tissue vs. its paired ANCT and classified patients based on these values to upregulation and downregulation groups. No significant associations were found between patients’ clinicopathological data and fold changes of ex- pression of these genes in tumoral tissues compared with ANCTs.

Title: Immunotherapy in Allergic Rhinitis: It's Effect on the Immune System and Clinical Symptoms
Word count: 2998
Similarity: 0.86689657
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis is one of the most common allergic diseases and characterised by sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion and nasopharyngeal itching. Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) for specific allergens is an effective treatment and induces the inhibitory effect of T regulatory lymphocytes and decreases clinical symptoms in allergic rhinitis. AIM: In this study effect of subcutaneous immunotherapy with specific allergens on clinical symptoms and T regulatory and T Helper cells cytokines, in patients with allergic rhinitis are evaluated. METHODS: In this study, 30 patients with moderate to severe allergic rhinitis according to clinical criteria and positive skin prick test for aeroallergens were selected and treated by SCIT. Clinical symptoms and T cells cytokines IL4, IL17, IFN gamma, TGF beta, GITR, FOXP3 and IL-10 (by RT-PCR) were evaluated before and one year after initiation of treatment. RESULTS: Thirty (30) patients with allergic rhinitis at age range 15-45 years old were treated by SCIT, and 23 (14 female, 9 male) patients continued the study, and 7 patients did not continue treatment. After immunotherapy, clinical symptoms decreased significantly. The specific cytokines TGF beta and IL10 levels increased and changes were statistically significant. (Respectively P = 0.013 and P = 0.05) The IL17 level was also increased, but not statistically significant. (P = 0.8) IFN gamma, IL4, GITR, FOXP3, all decreased, but the changes were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Subcutaneous Immunotherapy for specific allergens decreases clinical symptoms in patients with allergic rhinitis and induces tolerance in T lymphocytes, especially by increasing T regulatory cells cytokines, TGF beta and IL10
Basic summary: AIM: In this study effect of subcutaneous immunotherapy with specific allergens on clinical symptoms and T regulatory and T Helper cells cytokines, in patients with allergic rhinitis are evaluated. Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) for specific allergens is an effective treatment and induces the inhibitory effect of T regulatory lymphocytes and decreases clinical symptoms in allergic rhinitis. Immunotherapy in Allergic Rhinitis: It’s Effect on the Immune System _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Open Access Maced J Med Sci. It seems that immunotherapy has a major role in the induction of specific Treg cells and that the induction of tolerance in T lymphocytes is the base of immunotherapy. In our study, a significant decrease was observed in the clinical symptoms of allergic rhinitis patients after immunotherapy. Natural Treg cells react to autoantibodies which are expressed in the thymus whereas Inducable Treg cells react towards peripheral antigens which are expressed by dendritic cells . In the mentioned study those Treg cells originating from the thymus were named as nT-reg cells, and those forming outside the thymus were called aT-reg (adaptive) cells . In a study by Jutel et al., in 2003 in Switzerland, the mechanism of immunotherapy was studied in HDM- sensitive patients after 70 days of immunotherapy. The present study aimed at evaluating the effect of immunotherapy on the clinical symptoms and cytokine changes related to T lymphocytes in moderate to severe AR patients. Each of these subsets has a specific marker and express their specific receptors which for nTreg cells include CCR4/GITR/CTLA4/CD62L and for iTreg cells include IL10/TGF-beta.

Title: Effects of Zingiber officinale hydro-alcoholic extract on\ud
HMG-COA reductase level in the testis of streptozotocininduced diabetic rats
Word count: 3553
Similarity: 0.9218443
Abstract: Introduction: Zingiber officinale Roscoe, commonly known as ginger, is used as a cooking spice and therapeutically for its antioxidant and androgenic activities. We investigated the effects of Z. officinale hydro-alcoholic extract on HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase level in the testis of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Methods: The current experimental study was performed on four groups of male Wistar rats one of them was kept as a healthy control, while the others were rendered diabetic via a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (60 mg kg-1). One group was considered as diabetic control; while the others were given orally hydro-alcoholic extract (200 and 400 mg kg-1) for 56 consecutive days. Body weight, blood glucose and insulin concentrations were evaluated using standard methods. The HMG-COA reductase level was determined by western blot analysis. Results: Treatment with the extract resulted in a significant reduction of serum glucose concentration and HMG-COA reductase level in the rat’s testis compared to diabetic controls (P<0.01). A significant increase in body weight was observed in treated diabetic rats. Also, serum insulin was significantly increased in diabetic rats treated with 400 mg/kg of the extract compared to diabetic controls (P<0.05). Conclusion: Ginger has a potential influence on the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis by modulating of HMG-COA reductase level. The results provide scientific evidence to confirm the traditional use of Z. officinale in the treatment of diabetes mellitus
Basic summary: On the other hand, serum insulin level was significantly higher in diabetic rats treated with 400 mg/kg of Z. officinale extract than diabetic controls (29,30). Conclusion The oral administration of Z. officinale hydro-alcoholic extract has been shown to increases body weight, reduce blood glucose concentration and improve serum insulin levels in STZ-induced diabetic rats. Raw ginger extract can decrease serum cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels in diabetic rats and it has the great effect for controlling of diabetic complications (32). We investigated the effects of Z. officinale hydro-alcoholic extract on HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase level in the testis of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. According to the present study, Z. officinale extract can prevent weight loss in rats with STZ-induced diabetic and this effect may be related to its hypoglycemic properties. Some studies have shown that the ethanol extract of Z. officinale alleviates plasma lipids in cholesterol fed hyperlipidemia rabbits (12,13) and in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats (14). Also, serum insulin was significantly increased in diabetic rats treated with 400 mg/kg of the extract compared to diabetic controls (P < 0.05). Results: Treatment with the extract resulted in a significant reduction of serum glucose concentration and HMG-COA reductase level in the rat’s testis compared to diabetic controls (P < 0.01). Anti- diabetic and anti-oxidant effects of Zingiber officinale on alloxan-induced and insulin-resistant diabetic male rats. The effect of Z. officinale extract on the body weight, insulin level, and fasting blood glucose concentrations were assessed and the results are presented elsewhere (19).

Title: Digital work design : the interplay of human and computer in future work practices as an interdisciplinary (grand) challenge
Word count: 3541
Similarity: 0.9256937
Abstract: Erworben im Rahmen der Schweizer Nationallizenzen (http://www.nationallizenzen.ch)More and more academic studies and practitioner reports claim that human work is increasingly disrupted or even determined by information and communication technology (ICT) (Cascio and Montealegre 2016). This will make a considerable share of jobs currently performed by humans susceptible to automation (e.g., Frey and Osborne 2017; Manyika et al. 2017). These reports often sketch a picture of ‘machines taking over’ traditional domains like manufacturing, while ICT advances and capabilities seem to decide companies’ fate. Consequently, ICT is often put at the core of innovative efforts. While this applies to nearly all areas of workplace design, a recent popular example of increasing technology centricity is ‘Industry 4.0’, which is often delineated as ‘machines talking to computers’
Basic summary: Digital work designers must understand how and why things work before they can provide a digital solution to support work practices. 1 shows, traditional work design touches on motivational (e.g., autonomy and task variety), social (e.g., interdependence), and contextual (e.g., ergonomics) work design characteristics. 2 The Roots and Key Characteristics of Digital Work Design Workplace design has a long-standing tradition in ergo- nomics (Luczak 2013) and human-oriented computer sci- ence (Floyd et al. Organ Sci 11(4):404–428 Parker SK, Wall TD, Cordery JL (2001) Future work design research and practice: towards an elaborated model of work design. 1 Work design characteristics and work outcomes (based on Humphrey et al. If one accepts this change in the nature of work, researchers and practitioners need new approaches to analyze and (re)design work practices.

Title: On the Obsolescence of Bourgeois Theory in the Anthropocene
Word count: 2421
Similarity: 0.9037128
Abstract: ‘On the Obsolescence of Bourgeois Theory in the Anthropocene’ is an attempt to think theory beyond the stereotypes of what it is considered to be. This includes preconceived notions of what it is to be a  theorist, and to create, publish and disseminate critical theory.Many thinkers, for example, are currently attempting to replace the tyranny of the human with an emphasis on the nonhuman, the posthuman and the Anthropocene. Yet such ‘post-theory’ theorists continue to remain bound up with the human in the very performance of their attempts to think through and beyond it. Regardless of the anti-humanist philosophies they profess — be they inspired by Deleuze, Kittler or Latour  — in their practices, in the forms their work takes, in the ways they create, publish and disseminate it, in their associated upholding of notions of individual human rights, freedom, property and so on, they continue to operate in terms of a liberal, humanist model of what it is to be and do as a theorist. ‘On the Obsolescence of Bourgeois Theory in the Anthropocene’ thus asks, what forms is critical theory to take if, in its performance, it is not to be simply liberal and humanist — nor indeed human — but something else besides? In this way it endeavours to anticipate a future where new roles and conditions for theory materialize that has never previously been imagined
Basic summary: The nonhuman may be what a lot of contemporary theory studies and writes about, then, but it cannot take seriously the implications of the nonhuman for theory. Like the bourgeois novel, such theory — with rare exceptions — ‘draws a sharp distinction between the human and the nonhuman’, not to mention the ‘collective and collaborative’. Certainly, from the point of view of bourgeois theory, that which is outside its inherited liberal humanist frame in this respect can only appear as ‘strange’, ‘weird’, ‘freaky’. Just as ‘serious fiction, like bourgeois culture, now seems rather unserious, indeed frivolous’, so too does serious theory. For if the inhuman equals the human intertwined with the nonhuman, then a humanities with this intra-active inhuman figure at their heart must become the inhumanities. For ours is a time when theory too can be said to obscure rather than express the changing nature of the times and the time of nature.

Title: Improving Transformational Teaching and Learning by Advancing Higher Education Feedback-Based Dialogues at Texas A&M University
Word count: 3328
Similarity: 0.87876403
Abstract: Feedback mechanisms are critical to iteratively improving most societal systems, and yet there is minimal documentation on the best practices of leveraging feedback to improve teaching and learning in higher education. We attest that facilitated dialogues have the potential to start conversations relevant to improving policy that otherwise would not transpire. In higher education, facilitated dialogues between students, faculty, staff, and administration provide a unique face-to-face opportunity for all participants to provide feedback to one another on real-time institutional strengths and weaknesses. More specifically, facilitated dialogues have the potential to start a conversation on improving the learning in higher education. This work notes the theory facilitated dialogues and offers discussion on the long-term potential for such conversations to serve as a medium for iterative feedback in larger societal systems. Further, this thesis documents our development of a facilitated dialogue, The Student-Faculty Dialogue, which will act as a plenary event at Texas A&M?s inaugural Transformational Teaching and Learning Conference on April 17, 2018
Basic summary: 5 CHAPTER I METHODS Plenary Event Structure We developed a framework for a two-hour facilitated dialogue event through iterative analysis of small scale student-faculty dialogue events. This event will accommodate a diverse group of approximately 100 students and 100 faculty members who are interested in learning how to enhance the classroom experience for both parties. Facilitation Results from the Student-Faculty Dialogue event and associated discussion will be released following the plenary event on April 17, 2018. The plenary conference event closes with time for audience participation in defining the event’s call to action. Right image – Small scale Student-Faculty Dialogue to prepare for 200-participant April 17th plenary conference event in the student union. A student-faculty dialogue is a highly beneficial event for both parties to attend and can lead to an increase in student confidence, classroom conversations and reciprocal compassion.

Title: Identification and Characterization of a Mutated Gene Affecting NPC assembly
Word count: 3616
Similarity: 0.8829227
Abstract: The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a gateway that controls what is exchanged across the nuclear envelope. Therefore, when something affects its assembly, the cell will die. The laboratory has a collection of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant strains with NPC assembly defects, but where these defects are located and how they are related to NPC assembly remains unknown. The goal of this project is to identify the mutated gene that is causing assembly defects within one of the strains. Fluorescent microscopy was used to confirm the presence of a NPC assembly defect, and the growth rate of the mutant strain was measured at the permissive and nonpermissive temperature. Additionally, a genomic library was used to compliment the temperature sensitive defect as well as NPC assembly defect. Fluorescent microscopy confirmed the presence of an assembly defect. It was additionally found that the growth rate of the mutant was significantly slower at the nonpermissive temperature. Upon completing all transformations, none of the plasmids in the genomic library rescued the mutant. With information still missing by the mechanism of which NPC?s are formed, identifying and characterizing genes that affect NPC assembly can lead to more information about it
Basic summary: Fluorescent microscopy was used to confirm the presence of a NPC assembly defect, and the growth rate of the mutant strain was measured at the permissive and nonpermissive temperature. Identifying genes that affect nuclear pore complex assembly, or the nuclear pore complex itself, provide more information about this vital process in every eukaryotic organism. Indeed, the wild-type cells shows a bright and continuous GFP pattern around the nucleus, indicating normal assembly and functioning nuclear pore assembly (npa) genes. This difference in growth rate signifies that the npa mutant of KRY141 is temperature sensitive and will fail to adequately grow when shifted to the nonpermissive temperature. Additionally, a tiled genomic library was used to compliment the temperature sensitive defect as well as NPC assembly defect. A yeast genomic library (collection of genomic DNA from yeast) was used to rescue the mutation in order to learn more about what genes affect assembly. The growth rates at room temperature were later used in comparison with the growth rates at the nonpermissive temperature. Genomic Complementation As seen from Table 2, none of the plasmids in the Prelich library were able to successfully rescue the temperature sensitive mutant phenotype (Jones, Prelich et. Doubling times of the wild-type and mutant strains were found at room temperature in order to establish their normal growth rate. As seen in Table 1, the slower doubling time between KRY141 and YGS53 at the nonpermissive temperature supports the fact that the npa defect is temperature sensitive.

Abstract: A Collaborative Interaction Management System (CIMS) is a system that potentially provide some assistance to the teachers in managing the studentâ€™s collaborative interaction in forum discussions. The projected main function of the CIMS is to provide tools that automatically gauge the quality of interaction as reflected in studentâ€™s individual contributions so as to make it easier for the instructor to make judgments on the effectiveness of the collaborative process. This study aims to assess&nbsp;&nbsp; how effective and usable is the developed CIMS based on the evaluation of faculty and students. The descriptive research design is utilized in this study. The five-point Likert scale is used and the gathered data are statistically interpreted through the utilisation of a weighted mean. The sample population of this study is the one hundred twenty participants coming from the different universities in the area where the survey was conducted. The researcher adopted a survey instrument made by some software specialists. The bases of the instrument are some of the characteristics listed on the software quality model of ISO 9126. These are the functionality, usability and the reliability. Each of these software characteristics is described by some indicators to obtain the responses of the participants. The overall evaluation of the participants displayed the weighted mean of 4.0, thus it can be concluded that the functionality, usability and reliability of the software is very good

Abstract: Previous work in the literature has studied gravitational radiation inblack-hole collisions at the speed of light. In particular, it had been provedthat the perturbative field equations may all be reduced to equations in onlytwo independent variables, by virtue of a conformal symmetry at each order inperturbation theory. The Green function for the perturbative field equations ishere analyzed by studying the corresponding second-order hyperbolic operatorwith variable coefficients, instead of using the reduction method from theretarded flat-space Green function in four dimensions. After reduction tocanonical form of this hyperbolic operator, the integral representation of thesolution in terms of the Riemann function is obtained. The Riemann functionsolves a characteristic initial-value problem for which analytic formulaeleading to the numerical solution are derived.Comment: 15 pages, plain Tex.

With the aid of this concept, we establishthe law of total probability and Bayes' theorem in Riesz spaces; we also provean inclusion-exclusion formula in Riesz spaces. Several examples are providedto show that the law of total probability, Bayes' theorem andinclusion-exclusion formula in probability theory are special cases of ourresults
Basic summary: Law of total probability and Bayes’ theorem in Riesz spaces In probability theory, the law of total probability and Bayes’ theorem are two fundamental theorems involving conditional probability. Conditional probability in Riesz spaces To extend the notion of conditional probability in probability theory to Riesz spaces, we first recall the following definition. A band B in a Riesz space is said to be a projection band if X equals the direct sum of B and Bd, that is, X = B⊕Bd.

Title: LEAD IN THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE CITY OF DNIPRO AND ITS BIOMONITORING IN THE BODY OF THE PRESCHOOL CHILDREN
Word count: 2074
Similarity: 0.940446
Abstract: Among a variety of chemical environmental factors that adversely affect the health of the population, especially dangerous are the heavy metals. The most widespread among them is lead. Numerous researches by scientists indicate the negative impact of this metal on health and, above all, on the health of the children's population. The purpose of the work is a comprehensive hygienic assessment of the content of the lead in environmental objects of an environmentally dangerous area and its impact on the health of children of preschool age. The studies on the content of lead in the air, drinking water, local food products in 2 industrial districts of the city of Dnipro and conditionally clean area have been conducted. Its total daily income in the body of preschool children who live in these areas has been calculated. Its content in the biosubstrates of these children (blood, hair, teeth and urine) has been determined. The obtained data made it expedient and necessary to develop and implement a set of measures, the aim of which is to reduce the external "stress" of this abiotic metal and to increase the resistance and adaptability of the child's body
Basic summary: Multiple correlation analysis indicates that the lead content in the blood and hair is most closely related to the concentration of the lead in the food. A reliable correlation between the lead content in the environmental objects and its concentration in the children's biosubstrates has been established. At the same time, the lead content in the children's hair is 1.6 times higher than in the adults’, which may be due to its more active absorption. Antonova O. V. Monitoring of the changes of the premorbid indicators of the children's health under the influence of low lead concentrations // Укр. The level of the lead in the blood is the main indicator of its influence on the health of children. A pair correlation analysis found that the content of the lead in the blood is directly proportional to the activity of the δ-ALA and accumulation in the hair. In regional food products, the lead was continuously determined in the concentrations of 0.01 0.1 mg / kg, which is not higher than MLC. This is due to the detection of some neurotoxic disorders of the children exposed to the relatively low and previously perceived as safe levels of the lead.

Title: Condition of periapical tissues in endodonically treated teeth
Word count: 2761
Similarity: 0.9118438
Abstract: The aim of the study was to evaluate the possible relationship between the quality of restoration of the tooth crown, root canal obturation and periapical status of endodontic teeth. A series of X-ray images from randomly selected patient cards was studied at the Dental Faculty of the Dnepropetrovsk Medical Academy. A total of 1001 endodontically treated teeth restored by permanent restoration were evaluated independently by two experts. According to a predetermined set of radiographic criteria, the technical quality of filling the root canals of the tooth was assessed as good (GE) or poor (PE). In turn, the technical quality of restoration of the tooth crown was also evaluated as good (GR), or poor (PR). Then, the roots of the teeth and the surrounding tissues were evaluated, and according to the available treatment result were classified as successful or unsuccessful. The success rate for all endodontic teeth was 66.4 % (n ‰ 1001). Teeth with root pins had a success rate of 72.7 % (n ‰ 527), the success rate of dental treatment without pins was 64.6% (n ‰ 472). The two groups with technically good endodontics had the highest success rates. In combination with technically good restorations, the success rate was 82% (GE + GR, 82 %), in the case of technically weak restorations, the success rate was 72 % (GE + PR, 72 %). Two groups with technically bad endodontics combined with good restorations or poor restorations had significantly lower success rates (PE + GR, 55 % and PE = PR, 57 %). When assessing the periapical status of endodontic teeth, it was found that the quality of endodontic treatment, evaluated radiographically, is much more important than the quality of restoration of the crown of the tooth
Basic summary: *The difference between the success rate with Good Endodontics and Poor Endodontics was statistically significant (P<0.0001) re- gardless of the quality of the coronal restoration (GR or PR). Teeth with root pins had a success rate of 72.7 % (n ‰ 527), the success rate of dental treatment without pins was 64.6% (n ‰ 472). Teeth with root ca- nal posts (n=528 had a success rate of 72 % and teeth without posts (n=473) had a success rate of 64 %. However, if the quality of the root filling was poor, the quality of the coronal restoration was of no importance for the outcome of the endodontic treatment. *The difference between the success rate with Good Endodontics and Poor Endodontics was statistically significant (P_0.0001) re- gardless of the quality of the coronal restoration (GR or PR). The differ- ence between the success rate with Good Endodontics and Poor Endodontics was statistically significant regardless of the quality of the coronal restoration. The dif- ference between the success rate with Good Endodontics and Poor Endodontics was statistically significant regardless of the quality of the coronal restoration. If the quality of the root filling was good, a good restoration improved on the endodontic suc- cess rate. In the teeth diag- nosed with Poor Endodontics the success rate dropped and was the same regardless of the quality of the coronal restoration (PE+GR, 55% and PE+PR, 57%). **The difference between the success rate of teeth with Good and Poor Restoration was stastistically significant (P<0.001).

Abstract: The aim of the study was to evaluate the possible relationship between the quality of restoration of the tooth crown, root canal obturation and periapical status of endodontic teeth. A series of X-ray images from randomly selected patient cards was studied at the Dental Faculty of the Dnepropetrovsk Medical Academy. A total of 1001 endodontically treated teeth restored by permanent restoration were evaluated independently by two experts. According to a predetermined set of radiographic criteria, the technical quality of filling the root canals of the tooth was assessed as good (GE) or poor (PE). In turn, the technical quality of restoration of the tooth crown was also evaluated as good (GR), or poor (PR). Then, the roots of the teeth and the surrounding tissues were evaluated, and according to the available treatment result were classified as successful or unsuccessful. The success rate for all endodontic teeth was 66.4 % (n ‰ 1001). Teeth with root pins had a success rate of 72.7 % (n ‰ 527), the success rate of dental treatment without pins was 64.6% (n ‰ 472). The two groups with technically good endodontics had the highest success rates. In combination with technically good restorations, the success rate was 82% (GE + GR, 82 %), in the case of technically weak restorations, the success rate was 72 % (GE + PR, 72 %). Two groups with technically bad endodontics combined with good restorations or poor restorations had significantly lower success rates (PE + GR, 55 % and PE = PR, 57 %). When assessing the periapical status of endodontic teeth, it was found that the quality of endodontic treatment, evaluated radiographically, is much more important than the quality of restoration of the crown of the tooth
Basic summary: *The difference between the success rate with Good Endodontics and Poor Endodontics was statistically significant (P<0.0001) re- gardless of the quality of the coronal restoration (GR or PR). Teeth with root pins had a success rate of 72.7 % (n ‰ 527), the success rate of dental treatment without pins was 64.6% (n ‰ 472). Teeth with root ca- nal posts (n=528 had a success rate of 72 % and teeth without posts (n=473) had a success rate of 64 %. However, if the quality of the root filling was poor, the quality of the coronal restoration was of no importance for the outcome of the endodontic treatment. *The difference between the success rate with Good Endodontics and Poor Endodontics was statistically significant (P_0.0001) re- gardless of the quality of the coronal restoration (GR or PR). The differ- ence between the success rate with Good Endodontics and Poor Endodontics was statistically significant regardless of the quality of the coronal restoration. The dif- ference between the success rate with Good Endodontics and Poor Endodontics was statistically significant regardless of the quality of the coronal restoration. If the quality of the root filling was good, a good restoration improved on the endodontic suc- cess rate. In the teeth diag- nosed with Poor Endodontics the success rate dropped and was the same regardless of the quality of the coronal restoration (PE+GR, 55% and PE+PR, 57%). **The difference between the success rate of teeth with Good and Poor Restoration was stastistically significant (P<0.001).

Title: Solving the dark matter problem through dynamic interactions
Word count: 2851
Similarity: 0.86686254
Abstract: Owing to the renewed interest in dark matter after the upgrade of the largehadron collider and its dedication to dark matter research it is timely toreassess the whole problem. Considering dark matter is one way to reconcile thediscrepancy between the velocity of matter in the outer regions of galaxies andthe observed galactic mass. So far, no credible candidate for dark matter hasbeen identified. Here, we develop a model accounting for observations byrotations and interactions between rotating objects analogous to magneticfields and interactions with moving charges. The magnitude of these fields isdescribed by a fundamental constant of the order 10-41kg-1. The sameinteractions can be observed in the solar system where they lead to smallchanges in planetary orbits.Comment: 4 pages and 3 figure
Basic summary: Hence, FR = R(r)×V(r) = −µR MV 20 r er (4) for a suitably chosen value of the rotor constant µR. The field R for positive rotation can then be described by: R (r) = µR ez r ∫ dr′ρ(r′)2pir′V (r′). If rotor fields and their interactions are real, then they must apply to all rotating masses, as well as to the mass within the solar system. Considering dark matter is one way to reconcile the discrepancy between the velocity of matter in the outer regions of galaxies and the observed galactic mass. The assumption that the perihelion advance of Mercury, as shown in Figure 3, is due to rotor fields would allow us to calibrate the rotor field constant. The rotor constant µR can be calculated from existing data with the relationship between velocities V , galactic mass M , and acceleration constant a0.

Abstract: In the present work, we attempt to find a new class of solutions for thespherically symmetric perfect fluid sphere by employing the HomotopyPerturbation Method (HPM), a new tool via which the mass polynomial functionfacilitates to tackle the Einstein field equations. A set of interior solutionsfound on the basis of the simplest MIT bag model equation of state (EOS) in theform $p=\frac{1}{3}(\rho-4B)$ where $B$ is the bag constant. The proposedinterior metric for the stellar system is consistent with the exteriorSchwarzschild spacetime on the boundary. In addition, we also conduct adetailed study on different tests, viz. the energy conditions, TOV equation,adiabatic index, Buchdahl limit, etc., to verify the physical validity of theproposed model. The numerical value of the used parameters is predicted fordifferent strange star candidates, for different chosen values of the bagconstant. In a nutshell, by exploiting HPM technique first time ever in thefield of relativistic astrophysics, we have predicted in the present literaturea singularity-free and stable stellar model which is suitable to describeultra-dense objects, like strange (quark) stars.Comment: 19 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables, major revisio

Title: Interaction and Identification of the Doubly Heavy Di-Hadronic Molecules
Word count: 2776

Abstract: We study the interesting problem of interaction and identification of thehadronic molecules which seem to be deuteron-like structure. In particular, wepropose a binding mechanism in which One Boson Exchange Potential plus Yukawascreen-like potential is applied in their relative s-wave state. We propose thedipole-like interaction between two color neutral states to form a hadronicmolecule. For the identification of the hadronic molecules, the Weinberg'scompositeness theorem is used to distinguish the molecule from confined(elementary) state. The present formalism predict some di-hadronic molecularstates, involving quarks (s, c, b or $\overline{s}$, $\overline{c}$,$\overline{b}$) as a constituents, namely, $pn$, $K\overline{K}$, $\rho\overline{\rho}$, $K^{*}\overline{K^{*}}$,$D\overline{D^{*}}$($\overline{D}D^{*}$), $D^{*}\overline{D^{*}}$,$B\overline{B^{*}}$, $B^{*}\overline{B^{*}}$,  $D^{*\pm}\overline{D_{1}^{0}}$, $ D^{0}\overline{K^{\pm}}$,$D^{*0}\overline{K^{\pm}}$, with their possible quantum numbers.Comment: 10 page
Basic summary: the hadrons should be heavy enough to get bound state (ii) the two hadron should carry lowest orbital angular momentum (l=0) (iii) molecular state should be loosely bound (i.e. Thus we have approximate interaction potential as discussed and revisited Weinberg’s approach in order to determine the composite state from bare state. Let us describe the interaction potential in terms of the well defined One Boson Exchange (OBE) potential and phenomenological attractive screen Yukawa-like potential. The threshold of hadronic molecules consist of doubly heavy quark (c,b or c, b). In general for such bound state, gen- uinely, a simple question arises- How and why two hadrons make a bound state?

Title: Two-way communication with a single quantum particle

Abstract: In this letter we show that communication when restricted to a singleinformation carrier (i.e. single particle) and finite speed of propagation isfundamentally limited for classical systems. On the other hand, quantum systemscan surpass this limitation. We show that communication bounded to the exchangeof a single quantum particle (in superposition of different spatial locations)can result in "two-way signaling" which is impossible in classical physics. Wequantify the discrepancy between classical and quantum scenarios by theprobability of winning a game played by distant players. We generalize ourresult to an arbitrary number of parties and we show that the probability ofsuccess is asymptotically decreasing to zero as the number of parties grows,for all classical strategies. In contrast, quantum strategy allows players towin the game with certainty.Comment: Published version.

Title: Three-dimensional anomalous twisted gauge theories with global symmetry:
  Implications for quantum spin liquids
Word count: 2520
Similarity: 0.36243165
Abstract: Topological spin liquids can be described by topological gauge theories withglobal symmetry. Due to the presence of both nontrivial bulk deconfined gaugefluxes and global symmetry, topological spin liquids are examples of theso-called "Symmetry Enriched Topological phases" (SET). In this paper, we findthat, in some twisted versions of topological gauge theories (with discreteAbelian gauge group $G_g$), implementing a global symmetry (denoted by $G_s$)is anomalous although symmetry charge carried by topological point-likeexcitations is normally fractionalized and classified by the second cohomologygroup. To demonstrate the anomaly, we fully gauge the global symmetry,rendering a new gauge theory that is not gauge invariant. Therefore, the SETorder of the ground state is anomalous, which cannot exist in 3D system alone.Such anomalous state construction generalizes the "2D surface topologicalorder" to 3D. A concrete example with $G_g=\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_4$ and$G_s=\mathbb{Z}_2$ is calculated.Comment: 4 page
Basic summary: (5,6), the coefficient q should be quantized as: either q = 8 mod 16 or q = 0 mod 16 such that the new gauge theory is gauge invariant. The coupling term (11) means that all Z4 gauge charge excitations carry Z2 symmetry charge while Z2 gauge charge excitations are not charged under Z2 sym- metry. • The anomalous gauge theory described by the ac- tion (24) may appear as a boundary state of a (4+1)D gauge theory (topological order state). In order to show the anomaly, we fully gauge the global symmetry and obtain a new gauge theory. However, the initial value of q before gauging is q = 4 mod 8, which explicitly leads to violation of gauge invariance in the new gauge the- ory. Therefore, the resulting new gauge theory is a Z2 × Z8 gauge theory with a twisted term.

Title: Assessment of the diagnostic score scales in acute appendicitis
Word count: 931
Similarity: 0.6583002
Abstract: Thus, the score in the range of 5 to 10 is a reliable mark of inflammatory changes in the appendix. At the same time, a direct correlation was found between the depth of inflammatory changes in the appendix walls and the sum of the scores. Thus, in the destructive forms of acute apendicitis, the sum of scores had higher indications than the catarrhal form. Given the erased clinical course of acute appendicitis during pregnancy in most cases, the scale can only be used in conjunction with other diagnostic methods
Basic summary: Thus, the leukogram indexes have a high informative value in assess- ing the severity of the inflammatory process and destructive changes in acute ap- pendicitis in pregnant women. During laparoscopy, 6 (7.5%) women of the first group showed no signs of inflammation of the appendix, and the diagnosis of acute appendicitis was excluded. Clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis has traditionally come first among other diagnostic methods, but the informative value of many ap- pendicular symptoms during pregnancy is low. Meanwhile, the possibility of a clinical blood test for acute appendicitis in pregnant women is not enough to reveal.

Title: Memory-Usage Advantageous Block Recursive Matrix Inverse
Word count: 2886
Similarity: 0.70977753
Abstract: The inversion of extremely high order matrices has been a challenging taskbecause of the limited processing and memory capacity of conventionalcomputers. In a scenario in which the data does not fit in memory, it is worthto consider exchanging less memory usage for more processing time in order toenable the computation of the inverse which otherwise would be prohibitive. Wepropose a new algorithm to compute the inverse of block partitioned matriceswith a reduced memory footprint. The algorithm works recursively to invert oneblock of a $k \times k$ block matrix $M$, with $k \geq 2$, based on thesuccessive splitting of $M$. It computes one block of the inverse at a time, inorder to limit memory usage during the entire processing. Experimental resultsshow that, despite increasing computational complexity, matrices that otherwisewould exceed the memory-usage limit can be inverted using this technique
Basic summary: With this notation, block Mαβ has dimension b× b, with b = m k , and M = (Mαβ) is a k − by − k block matrix. The proposed algorithm works recursively to invert one block of a k× k block matrix A, with k ≥ 2, based on the successive splitting of A. In , the authors give inverse formulae for 2×2 block matrices applied in block triangular matrices and various structured matrices such as Hamiltonian, per-Hermitian 2 and centro-Hermitian matrices. In , a recursive algorithm is applied for the determination of the first block row of the inverse of a block circulant matrix with circulant blocks. The forward recursive procedure terminates after k − 2 steps, when the resulting frames have 2 × 2 blocks. 〈〈M〉〉 =  〈〈M〉A〉 〈〈M〉B〉 〈〈M〉C〉 〈〈M〉D〉  (36) Thus, 〈〈M〉〉 is a 2 × 2 block matrix generated from the original 4 × 4 block matrix .

Title: Baryon Production at p-p Collider Experiments: Average Transverse
  Momenta vs. Energy and Mass
Word count: 3255
Similarity: 0.9379042
Abstract: This paper examines the transverse momentum spectra of baryons in the multiparticle production at modern colliders using Quark-Gluon String Model (QGSM).It discusses 1) the difference in \Lambda^0 hyperon spectra atantiproton-proton vs. proton-proton reactions; 2) the growth of averagetransverse momenta of \Lambda hyperon with proton-proton collision energies and3) the dependence of average p_t on the masses of mesons and baryons at the LHCenergy 7 TeV. This analysis of baryon spectra led to the following conclusions.First, the fragmentation of antidiquark-diquark side of pomeron diagram makesthe major contribution to baryon production spectra in the asymmetricantiproton-proton reaction. Second, the average p_t's of hyperons steadily growwith energy on the range from 53 GeV to 7 TeV. Since no dramatic changes wereseen in the characteristics of baryon production, the hadroproduction processesdo not cause the "knee" in the cosmic ray proton spectra at the energiesbetween Tevatron and LHC. Third, the average transverse momentum analysisthrough examining the different masses of baryons and hadrons reveals theregularity in the mass gaps between hadron generations. This observation givesthe possibility for more hadrons with the masses: 0.253, 0.688, 1.87, 5.09,13.7, 37.3, 101, 276, 749... GeV, which are produced by geometrical progressionwith the mass factor of order 2.71828. Such hadrons with the masses beyond therange of known heavy baryons may be multiquark states like tetraquarks,pentaquarks and so forth.Comment: 11 pages, 11 .eps figures, ICHEP16 poste
Basic summary: The analysis of average baryon transverse momenta in the framework of QGSM clearly demonstrates that the average transverse momentum of baryons grows steadily with energy (see figure 9). The pomeron diagrams of p − p and p¯ − p collisions are shown in the figure 6. The transverse momentum baryon spectra in antiproton-proton collisions (UA1, UA5, CDF) differ from the pt distributions of baryons in proton-proton collisions (ISR, STAR, LHC). The resulting spectra consist of the contribution from only diquark-antidiquark chain that allows us to see the pure form of baryon transverse momentum distributions in asymmetric case of fragmentation. 3 Baryon Transverse Momentum Distributions in QGSM The QGS Model has been devised for the description of rapidity distributions and hadron spectra in xF 10. 4.1 The Data of UA5 Experiment This subsection discusses the influence of quark composition of beam particles on the shape of transverse momentum spectra of Λ0 hyperon production. The heavy quark meson spectra were fitted with the same formula (1) as the baryon spectra (see the figure 10).

Abstract: The ability to interpret machine learning models has become increasinglyimportant now that machine learning is used to inform consequential decisions.We propose an approach called model extraction for interpreting complex,blackbox models. Our approach approximates the complex model using a much moreinterpretable model; as long as the approximation quality is good, thenstatistical properties of the complex model are reflected in the interpretablemodel. We show how model extraction can be used to understand and debug randomforests and neural nets trained on several datasets from the UCI MachineLearning Repository, as well as control policies learned for several classicalreinforcement learning problems.Comment: Presented as a poster at the 2017 Workshop on Fairness,  Accountability, and Transparency in Machine Learning (FAT/ML 2017
Basic summary: For a model f trained with gender available, we show how a decision tree extracted from f can be used to understand how f depends on gen- der. Given amodel f : X → Y, the interpretation produced by our algorithm is an approximationT (x) ≈ f (x), whereT is an interpretable model. We measure per- formance using accuracy relative to f on a held out test set, i.e., 1 |Xtest | ∑ x ∈Xtest I[T (x) = f (x)].

Title: Thermodynamic Properties of Kehagias-Sfetsos Black Hole \& KS/CFT

Word count: 2953
Similarity: 0.5241008
Abstract: We speculate on various thermodynamic features of the innerhorizon~(${\mathcal H}^{-}$) and outer horizons~(${\mathcal H}^{+}$) ofKehagias-Sfetsos~(KS) black hole~(BH) in the background of Ho\v{r}ava Lifshitzgravity. We compute particularly the \emph{area product, area sum, area minusand area division} of the BH horizons. We find that they all are \emph{not}showing universal behavior whereas the product is a universal quantity~[Pradhan P., \textit{Phys. Lett. B}, {\bf 747} (2015) {64}]. Based on theserelations, we derive the area bound of all horizons. From the area bound wederive the entropy bound and irreducible mass bound for all thehorizons~(${\mathcal H}^{\pm}$). We also observe that the \emph{First law} ofBH thermodynamics and \emph {Smarr-Gibbs-Duhem } relations do not hold for thisBH. The underlying reason behind this failure due to the scale invariance ofthe coupling constant. Moreover, we compute the\emph{Cosmic-Censorship-Inequality} for this BH which gives the lower bound forthe total mass of the spacetime and it is supported by cosmic cencorshipconjecture. Finally, we discuss the KS/CFT~(Conformal Field Theory)correspondence via a thermodynamic procedure.Comment: Version accepted in EP
Basic summary: Based on these relations, we computed area bound, entropy bound, irreducible mass bound, temperature bound and specific heat bound. It is also interesting to mentioned that except the area product, entropy product and irreducible mass product all the thermodynamic relations of KS BH are mass dependent. We speculated that area sum, area minus and area division are mass dependent quantities, whereas the product is a mass independent quantity. In our previous study , we derived the surface area product, BH entropy product, surface temperature product, Komar energy product and specific heat product for this BH. Besides the area or entropy product it should be known what happens in case of area sum, area minus and area division. (13) It is remarkable that the area product of KS BH is independent of mass but the area sum is not independent of the mass parameter. From area bound we derive entropy bound and irreducible mass bound for all the horizons (H±). From area bound we derive entropy bound and irreducible mass bound for both the horizons. Likewise, the entropy product and entropy sum of H± becomes: S−S+ = pi 2 4ω2 and S− + S+ = pi ( 4M2 − 1 ω ) . For this reason we extend our study by computing area sum, entropy sum, temperature sum and specific heat sum of all the horizons. We compute particularly area sum, area minus and area division of the BH horizons.

Title: The precision of parameter estimation for dephasing model under squeezed
  reservoir
Word count: 3453

Abstract: We study the precision of parameter estimation for dephasing model undersqueezed environment. We analytically calculate the dephasing factor$\gamma(t)$ and obtain the analytic quantum Fisher information (QFI) for theamplitude parameter $\alpha$ and the phase parameter $\phi$. It is shown thatthe QFI for the amplitude parameter $\alpha$ is invariant in the whole process,while the QFI for the phase parameter $\phi$ strongly depends on the reservoirsqueezing. It is shown that the QFI can be enhanced for appropriate squeezeparameters $r$ and $\theta$. Finally, we also investigate the effect oftemperature on the QFI
Basic summary: This shows that the squeeze phase parameter θ plays more significant role than the squeeze parameter r in this parameter estimation scheme. The environment ρbath is assumed to be the squeezed vacuum reservoir, which is given by ρbath = ∏ k Sk (r, θ) |0k〉 〈0k|Sk (r, θ) † . The competition between the squeeze parameter r and the squeeze phase parameter θ determines whether the QFI is enhanced or descended in the dephasing process. In this paper, we investigate the effects of reservoir squeez- ing on the estimation precision of the amplitude parameter α ∗Electronic address: quaninformation@sina.com and the phase parameter φ. We analytically calculate the dephasing factor γ(t) and obtain the analytic quantum Fisher information (QFI) for the amplitude parameter α and the phase parameter φ.

There is a central region, where it can be noticed the diffractionof laser light in the region of geometric shadow, while intensity oscillationsare observed in the non-obstructed area. On both sides of the edge, there arealso very long light traces along the normal to the edge of the obstacle. Thetheoretical explanation to this phenomenon is based on the Fresnel-Kirchhoffdiffraction theory applied to the Gaussian beam propagation behind theobstacle. Here we have supplemented this explanation by consideringelectromagnetic flow lines, which provide a more complete interpretation of thephenomenon in terms of electric and magnetic fields and flux lines, and thatcan be related, at the same time, with average photon paths.Comment: 13 pages, 5 figure

Abstract: The consequences of coupling magnetic and elastic degrees of freedom, wherespins and deformations are carried by point-like objects subject to localinteractions, are studied, theoretically and by detailed numerical simulations.From the constrained Lagrangians we derive consistent equations of motion forthe coupled dynamical variables. In order to probe the dynamics of such asystem, we consider external perturbations, such as spin transfer torques forthe magnetic part, and homogeneous stresses for the elastic part, associated totheir corresponding damping. This approach is applied to the study of ultrafastswitching processes in anti-ferromagnetic systems, which have recentlyattracted attention as candidates for anti-ferromagnetic spintronic devices.Our strategy is then checked in simple, but instructive, situations. We carriedout numerical experiments to study, in particular, how the magnetostrictivecoupling and external stresses affect the nature of the switching processes ina prototype anti-ferromagnetic material.Comment: 6 pages, LaTeX2e, 3 figures.

Abstract: We demonstrate a possibility to make rogue waves (RWs) in the form of thePeregrine soliton (PS) and Kuznetsov-Ma breathers (KMBs) effectively stableobjects, with the help of properly defined dispersion or nonlinearitymanagement applied to the continuous-wave (CW) background supporting the RWs.In particular, it is found that either management scheme, if applied along thelongitudinal coordinate, making the underlying nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation(NLSE) selfdefocusing in the course of disappearance of the PS, indeedstabilizes the global solution with respect to the modulational instability ofthe background. In the process, additional excitations are generated, namely,dispersive shock waves and, in some cases, also a pair of slowly separatingdark solitons. Further, the nonlinearity-management format, which makes theNLSE defocusing outside of a finite domain in the transverse direction, enablesthe stabilization of the KMBs, in the form of confined oscillating states. Onthe other hand, a nonlinearity-management format applied periodically along thepropagation direction, creates expanding patterns featuring multiplication ofKMBs through their cascading fission.Comment: Physics Letters A, on pres

Title: Determining the nature of white dwarfs from low-frequency gravitational
  waves
Word count: 2458
Similarity: 0.69273305
Abstract: An extreme-mass-ratio system composed of a white dwarf (WD) and a massiveblack hole can be observed by the low-frequency gravitational wave detectors,such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). When the mass of theblack hole is around $10^4 \sim 10^5 M_\odot$, the WD will be disrupted by thetidal interaction at the final inspiraling stage. The event position and timeof the tidal disruption of the WD can be accurately determined by thegravitational wave signals. Such position and time depend upon the mass of theblack hole and especially on the density of the WD. We present the theory byusing LISA-like gravitational wave detectors, the mass-radius relation and thenthe equations of state of WDs could be strictly constrained (accuracy up to$0.1\%$). We also point out that LISA can accurately predict the disruptiontime of a WD, and forecast the electromagnetic follow-up of this tidaldisruption event.Comment: 7 pages, 2 figure
Basic summary: Such position and time are determined by the mass and radius of WD and the mass of black hole. We find that the tidal radius is independent of the spin of the black hole (BH), but relates with the density of WD and mass of BH. The shadows with different color represent the range of mass and radius of compact object with a tidal disruption event seen by LISA. The measurement uncertainties of the masses of WD and black hole will also contribute to the measurement error of tidal disruption position. For a typical WD (µ = 2), we find that LISA can observe the tidal disruption of a small mass white dwarf (. When the mass of black hole is around 104 ∼ 105M , the WD will be disrupted by the tidal interaction at the final inspiralling stage.

Abstract: A transfer is a group homomorphism from a finite group to an abelian quotientgroup of a subgroup of the group. In this paper, we explain some of theproperties of transfers by using noncommutative determinants. These propertiesenable us to understand transfers more naturally
Basic summary: Therefore, there exists sgn(g) ∈ {−1, 1} such that Det(g) = det (ψ (LT (g))) = sgn(g) m∏ i=1 {( gti )−1 gti } K = sgn(g)VG→H/K(g). Furthermore, we can show that a transfer is a group homomorphism from G to K and a transfer by left coset representatives equals the transfer by right coset representatives. Thus, we have sgn(gh)VG→H/K(gh) = Det(gh) = Det(g)Det(h) = sgn(g)sgn(h)VG→H/K(g)VG→H/K(h).

Abstract: In this paper we show that both the homotopy category of strict$n$-categories, $1\leqslant n \leqslant \infty$, and the homotopy category ofSteiner's augmented directed complexes are equivalent to the category ofhomotopy types. In order to do so, we first prove an abstract result, based ona strategy of Fritsch and Latch, giving sufficient conditions for a nervefunctor with values in simplicial sets to induce an equivalence at the level ofhomotopy categories. We then apply this result to strict $n$-categories andaugmented directed complexes, for which the hypothesis of our theorem wereestablished by Ara and Maltsiniotis
Basic summary: We shall call weak equivalences of ∆̂ the usual weak homotopy equivalences and weak equivalences of ∆̂′ the morphisms such that their image by i! This definition provides us with an induced nerve functor at the level of the homotopy categories, that is the categories in which we localise at weak equivalences. We call weak equivalences of Cda the morphisms whose image by N is a weak equivalence of ∆̂.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel automatic face recognition approach based onlocal binary patterns. This descriptor considers a local neighbourhood of apixel to compute the feature vector values. This method is not very robust tohandle image noise, variances and different illumination conditions. We addressthese issues by proposing a novel descriptor which considers more pixels anddifferent neighbourhoods to compute the feature vector values. The proposedmethod is evaluated on two benchmark corpora, namely UFI and FERET facedatasets. We experimentally show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-artmethods and is efficient particularly in the real conditions where the abovementioned issues are obvious. We further show that the proposed method handleswell one training sample issue and is also robust to the image resolution.Comment: Submitted for VCIP 201

Title: Hand Segmentation for Hand-Object Interaction from Depth map
Word count: 2903
Similarity: 0.885396
Abstract: Hand segmentation for hand-object interaction is a necessary preprocessingstep in many applications such as augmented reality, medical application, andhuman-robot interaction. However, typical methods are based on colorinformation which is not robust to objects with skin color, skin pigmentdifference, and light condition variations. Thus, we propose hand segmentationmethod for hand-object interaction using only a depth map. It is challengingbecause of the small depth difference between a hand and objects during aninteraction. To overcome this challenge, we propose the two-stage randomdecision forest (RDF) method consisting of detecting hands and segmentinghands. To validate the proposed method, we demonstrate results on the publiclyavailable dataset of hand segmentation for hand-object interaction. Theproposed method achieves high accuracy in short processing time comparing tothe other state-of-the-art methods
Basic summary: In this paper, we propose the hand segmentation method for hand-object interaction using only a depth map to avoid the limitations of skin color-based methods. Thus, we propose hand segmentation method for hand-object interaction using only a depth map. At each leaf node, the algorithm stores the conditional probability p(h|l) (probability of being each class h given reaching the node l) for the prediction in a testing stage. B. Kang, Y. Lee, and T. Nguyen, “Efficient hand artic- ulations tracking using adaptive hand model and depth map,” in Advances in Visual Computing, Dec. 2015. CONCLUSION In this paper, we present two-stage RDF method for hand seg- mentation for hand-object interaction using only a depth map. The proposed method is compared with the RDF-based method in [1,19] and the fully convolutional networks (FCN) in [24, 25] using only a depth map. Using the inputs (x,D), the algorithm learns a split func- tion at each splitting node and a conditional probability distri- bution at each leaf node.

Abstract: The regularized theories are non-local at the scale of the cutoff, leading soto the usual difficulties of non-local theories. In this work the conservationlaws and causality are investigated for classical field theories withmulti-cluster action. The conservation laws are found to play a lesssignificant role than in local theories because due to the non-locality theconserved quantities are not integrals of the motion, and they can exist evenwithout underlying symmetries. Moreover, the conservation of the energy can notprevent instability brought about by the unbounded nature of the energy frombelow. Hence a sufficient condition of stability is lost. Theories, obtained byappropriate point splitting of local interactions are shown to be causalthereby a necessary condition of stability can be retained.Comment: final version, to appear in Eur. Phys.

Word count: 4431
Similarity: 0.9246819
Abstract: As the bioinformatics field grows, it must keep pace not only with new databut with new algorithms. Here we contribute a thorough analysis of 13state-of-the-art, commonly used machine learning algorithms on a set of 165publicly available classification problems in order to provide data-drivenalgorithm recommendations to current researchers. We present a number ofstatistical and visual comparisons of algorithm performance and quantify theeffect of model selection and algorithm tuning for each algorithm and dataset.The analysis culminates in the recommendation of five algorithms withhyperparameters that maximize classifier performance across the testedproblems, as well as general guidelines for applying machine learning tosupervised classification problems.Comment: 12 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables. To be published in the proceedings of  PSB 2018. Randal S. Olson and William La Cava contributed equally as co-first  author
Basic summary: Finally, we analyze how algorithms cluster across the tested problems, and present a set of algorithms that maximize performance across the datasets in Section 3.3. The rankings show the strength of ensemble-based tree algorithms in generating accurate models: The first, second, and fourth-ranked algorithms belong to this class of algorithms. The algorithms include Na¨ıve Bayes algorithms, common linear classifiers, tree-based al- gorithms, distance-based classifiers, ensemble algorithms, and non-linear, kernel-based strate- gies. We present a number of statistical and visual comparisons of algorithm performance and quantify the effect of model selection and algorithm tuning for each algorithm and dataset. Effect of Tuning and Model Selection Most ML algorithms contain several hyperparameters that can affect performance significantly (for example, the max tree depth of a decision tree classifier).

Title: Motion of a rod pushed at one point in a weightless environment in space
Word count: 2446
Similarity: 0.87149304
Abstract: We analyze the motion of a rod floating in a weightless environment in spacewhen a force is applied at some point on the rod in a direction perpendicularto its length. If the force applied is at the centre of mass, then the rod getsa linear motion perpendicular to its length. However, if the same force isapplied at a point other than the centre of mass, say, near one end of the rod,thereby giving rise to a torque, then there will also be a rotation of the rodabout its centre of mass, in addition to the motion of the centre of massitself. If the force applied is for a very short duration, but impartingnevertheless a finite impulse, like in a sudden (quick) hit at one end of therod, then the centre of mass will move with a constant linear speed andsuperimposed on it will be a rotation of the rod with constant angular speedabout the centre of mass. However, if force is applied continuously, say bystrapping a tiny rocket at one end of the rod, then the rod will spin fasterand faster about the centre of mass, with angular speed increasing linearlywith time. As the direction of the applied force, as seen by an external(inertial) observer, will be changing continuously with the rotation of therod, the acceleration of the centre of mass would also be not in one fixeddirection. However, it turns out that the locus of the velocity vector of thecentre of mass will describe a Cornu spiral, with the velocity vector reachinga final constant value with time. The mean motion of the centre of mass will bein a straight line, with superposed initial oscillations that soon die down.Comment: 8 pages, 4 figures, to appear in Physics Educatio
Basic summary: With the rotation of the rod, the direction of force f , which is assumed to be always perpendicular to the rod, will change continuously. The centre of mass C of the rod moves with a constant linear velocity v along the y direction. Suppose a force f is applied at some point on the rod, in a direction perpendicular to the length of the rod. But with the rotation of the rod, as the direction of force turns towards the −x direction, C picks up velocity in that direction. If the force applied is at the centre of mass, then the rod gets a linear motion perpendicular to its length. Therefore with respect to C, A has a speed v along y direction while B has a speed v in the opposite direction (Fig. In order to provide a continuous force perpendicular to the length of the rod, we could strap a tiny rocket to the rod at a point of our choosing. In addition, the rod rotates with a constant angular speed ω = 6v/l about C. end of the rod.

Title: Deep Residual Learning and PDEs on Manifold
Word count: 2540
Similarity: 0.45570058
Abstract: In this paper, we formulate the deep residual network (ResNet) as a controlproblem of transport equation. In ResNet, the transport equation is solvedalong the characteristics. Based on this observation, deep neural network isclosely related to the control problem of PDEs on manifold. We propose severalmodels based on transport equation and Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Thediscretization of these PDEs on point cloud is also discussed
Basic summary: u(x) = 1 w¯(x) ∑ xj∈T w(x,xj)u(xj) + |T | |S| ∑ xj∈S w(x,xj)g(xj), (10) where w¯(x) = ∑ xj∈T w(x,xj) + |T | |S| ∑ xj∈S w(x,xj). Corresponding discretization is Dku(x) = 1 w¯δ(x) ∑ y∈P (u(x)− u(y)) (xk − yk)Rδ(x,y)V (y). Dku(x) = 1 wδ(x) ∫ M (u(x)− u(y)) (xk − yk)Rδ(x,y)dy. In above control problem formulation (8), the terminal value u(x, 1) = f(x) and the model of the velocity field v(x, t) are very important. Velocity Field Model In ResNet, the model of the velocity field v(x, t) is v(x, t) = W (2)(t) · σ ( W (1)(t) · σ(x) ) .

Abstract: An uniformly accelerated (Rindler) observer will detect particles in theMinkowski vacuum, known as Unruh effect. The spectrum is thermal and thetemperature is given by that of the Killing horizon, which is proportional tothe acceleration. Considering these particles are kept in a thermal bath withthis temperature, we find that the correlation function of the random force dueto radiation acting on the particles as measured by the accelerated frame,shows the fluctuation-dissipation relation. It is observed that thecorrelations, in both ($1+1$) spacetime and ($1+3$) dimensional spacetimes, areof Brownian type. We discuss the implications of this new observation at theend.Comment: The para above Eq. (6) has been modified, to appear in Phys. Rev. 
Basic summary: Hence for our practical purpose we keep our region of integra- tion from X = X(T ) to X →∞. Following the steps of , we obtain F (T ) = −X ′(T )T 01[T,X(T )] + T 00[T,X(T )] , (2) where X ′(T ) = dX/dT . 3Then, it follows that the the correlation function of the random force is dependant upon the correlation function of the spacetime derivatives of the scalar field. Therefore, the observer moves from X = X(T ), which is given by the equation for the path, to∞. Correlation Function in Minkowski Spacetime: The correlation function is determined by taking the aver- age of product of the random force amplitudes at two different time-points T1 and T2. (10), that x˜0 = x01 − x 0 2 is finite while x˜ 1 = x11 − x 1 2 is very small. Here, the integration spans from X = X(T ) to ∞.

  detection task
Word count: 1890
Similarity: 0.78624123
Abstract: Identifying public misinformation is a complicated and challenging task. Animportant part of checking the veracity of a specific claim is to evaluate thestance different news sources take towards the assertion. Automatic stanceevaluation, i.e. stance detection, would arguably facilitate the process offact checking. In this paper, we present our stance detection system whichclaimed third place in Stage 1 of the Fake News Challenge. Despite ourstraightforward approach, our system performs at a competitive level with thecomplex ensembles of the top two winning teams. We therefore propose our systemas the 'simple but tough-to-beat baseline' for the Fake News Challenge stancedetection task.Comment: 6 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables; additional reference and details added,  typos and wording correcte
Basic summary: 2 Model description Our stance detection model is a single, end-to-end system consisting of lexical and similarity features fed through a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with one hidden layer. More specifically, FNC-1 involved developing a model that, given a news article headline and a news article body, estimates the stance of the body towards the headline. We therefore propose our model as the ‘simple but tough-to-beat baseline’ for the Fake News Challenge stance detection task. The performance of our model is summarised by below confusion matrix for the label predictions submitted on the final test set (see Table 2). In this paper, we present our stance detection model which claimed third place in the first stage of the Fake News Challenge. 2.4 Hyperparameters The full set of hyperparameters of the model, their labels, their descriptions, the ranges of values considered, and corresponding optimised values are provided in Table 1. 2 2.3 Training Our training objective was to minimise the cross entropy between the model’s softmax probabilities and the true labels.

Abstract: A new experimental set-up for Boltzmann constant measurement is described.Statistically averaged square of voltage $\left<U^2\right>$ is measured fordifferent capacitances $C$. Boltzmann constant is determined by theequipartition theorem $C\left<U^2\right>=k_{_\mathrm{B}}T$. For fixedcapacitance, voltages could be measured for different temperatures. The set-upconsists of low-noise high frequency operational amplifiers ADA4898-2. Aninstrumental amplifier is followed by an inverting amplifier, square of thevoltage is created by an analog multiplier AD633 and finally the averagedsignal is measured by a multimeter.Comment: 14 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables, 2 appendice
Basic summary: Statistically averaged square of voltage 〈 U2 〉 is measured for different capacitances C. Boltzmann constant is determined by the equipartition theorem C 〈 U2 〉 = kBT .

Title: A General and Adaptive Robust Loss Function

Abstract: We present a generalization of the Cauchy/Lorentzian, Geman-McClure,Welsch/Leclerc, generalized Charbonnier, Charbonnier/pseudo-Huber/L1-L2, and L2loss functions. By introducing robustness as a continous parameter, our lossfunction allows algorithms built around robust loss minimization to begeneralized, which improves performance on basic vision tasks such asregistration and clustering. Interpreting our loss as the negative log of aunivariate density yields a general probability distribution that includesnormal and Cauchy distributions as special cases. This probabilisticinterpretation enables the training of neural networks in which the robustnessof the loss automatically adapts itself during training, which improvesperformance on learning-based tasks such as generative image synthesis andunsupervised monocular depth estimation, without requiring any manual parametertuning
Basic summary: Our loss is valid for all real values of α and for all real, positive values of c. The loss increases monotonically with the magnitude of x. In this paper we present a single loss function that is a superset of many of these com- mon loss functions. Loss Function With this analysis in place, we can present our final loss function. As as result, this loss may be useful to practitioners wishing to easily and continuously explore a wide variety of robust loss functions.

We discuss differences between our method and selected computationalresults for insolation found in the literature.Comment: 5 pages, 2 figure
Basic summary: The precession dependence for annual insolation averages out over the course of a year because of their assumption that precession is constant over this time period.

Abstract: In last decades, diversity and accuracy have been regarded as two importantmeasures in evaluating a recommendation model. However, a clear concern is thata model focusing excessively on one measure will put the other one at risk,thus it is not easy to greatly improve diversity and accuracy simultaneously.In this paper, we propose to enhance the Resource-Allocation (RA) similarity inresource transfer equations of diffusion-like models, by giving a tunableexponent to the RA similarity, and traversing the value of the exponent toachieve the optimal recommendation results. In this way, we can increase therecommendation scores (allocated resource) of many unpopular objects.Experiments on three benchmark data sets, MovieLens, Netflix, and RateYourMusicshow that the modified models can yield remarkable performance improvementcompared with the original ones
Basic summary: A random recommendation will randomly choose L objects from the train set and recommend them to the target user, where L is the length of the recommendation list. The niche objects will receive lower final resources (recommendation scores) because they have fewer neighbor users (resource portals), thus rank in the bottom of the recommendation lists.

The presidential election also underlined that Czech politics is likely to take another step closer to Poland and Hungary, but with the key distinction that the country’s liberal opposition has shown an ability to unite against Zeman and garner almost 50% of the vote

Abstract: Kopi sangrai merupakan salah satu bahan minuman yang telah diketahui potensinya sebagai antibakteri untuk menghambat ataupun membunuh bakteri. Kemampuan antibakteri ini diketahui efektif terhadap berbagai jenis bakteri patogen, seperti Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli dan Streptococcus mutans (bakteri yang diketahui tumbuh dalam mulut manusia). Aktivitas antibakteri ini dapat meningkat jika kopi disangrai dalam waktu yang lebih lama ataupun pada suhu yang lebih tinggi. Hal ini disebabkan adanya senyawa melanoidin dan alfa dikarbonil yang dihasilkan dalam reaksi Maillard selama proses penyangraian. Selain dari itu, aktivitas antibakteri juga didapati pada berbagai senyawa fenolik dan kafein yang ada pada kopi sangrai. Sehubungan dengan adanya berbagai senyawa antibakteri pada kopi sangrai, maka diperlukan review untuk merangkum publikasi yang telah diterbitkan mengenai berbagai senyawa antibakteri pada kopi sangrai. Hal tersebut menjadi tujuan penulis dalam menulis review. Berdasarkan berbagai jenis senyawa antibakteri pada kopi sangrai, diketahui bahwa salah satu isomer dari asam klorogenat (5-caffeoylquinic acid) memiliki potensi antibakteri yang lebih tinggi dari senyawa fenolik lainnya. Asam klorogenat mampu mengubah nilai pH pada membran bakteri. Senyawa trigonelline dan kafein didapati memiliki aktivitas antibakteri yang lemah terhadap sebagian besar dari bakteri patogen. Kafein ditemukan memiliki kemampuan untuk meningkatkan aktivitas antibakteri dari senyawa lain, seperti senyawa alfa dikarbonil. Senyawa alfa dikarbonil dan melanoidin telah dikenal memiliki aktivitas antibakteri yang tinggi. Hal ini dipengaruhi oleh rendahnya nilai pH pada senyawa alfa dikarbonil (1,92 untuk methylglyoxal; 2,10 untuk glyoxal) dan kemampuan melanoidin untuk mengikat kation yang menstabilkan membran bakteri. Selain dari itu, melanoidin juga diketahui dapat mengikat kation yang terkandung dalam media sehingga tidak dapat dikonsumsi oleh bakteri. Dalam aplikasinya terhadap bakteri patogen, kopi sangrai beserta dengan senyawa antibakterinya didapati lebih efektif terhadap bakteri gram positif dibandingkan bakteri gram negatif. Beberapa senyawa antibakteri diketahui memiliki efektifitas terhadap bakteri tertentu, seperti efektifitas dari senyawa melanoidin terhadap bakteri yang dapat membentuk suatu kompleks dengan zat besi sebagai perlindungan terhadap sel (siderophore). Senyawa trigonelline juga diketahui memiliki efektifitas terhadap bakteri yang diketahui tumbuh dalam mulut dan menyebabkan peradangan pada gusi manusia

Title: Radiocarbon dating of mortar: Case study of the Aqueduct in Skopje
Word count: 87
Similarity: 0.80045515
Abstract: Dating of mortar has been a challenge since the early days of the radiocarbon dating method. The idea is to date only the carbon fixed in mortar at the time of binding (i.e., the binder). However, results of ¹⁴C mortar dating are often compromised with dead carbon contamination originating from unreacted limestone during preparation of quick lime. Also, non-binder carbon can be incorporated into mortar sample (1) due to precipitation of secondary carbonates from environment, (2) in case of fire accidents, it is replaced with the carbon from the atmosphere at the time of accident, or (3) if the mortar is too alkaline, it still incorporates carbon from the atmosphere. Therefore, an effort is placed into developing of a method that can isolate strictly the binder carbon, with the help of the accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) measurement technique enabling analyses of various phases of mortar. However, no reliable procedure has yet been established for each mortar type (Hajdas et al., 2017). The Zagreb Radiocarbon Laboratory was approached with a request to determinate time of the Aqueduct in Skopje (FYR Macedonia) construction through ¹⁴C dating of mortar samples. The Aqueduct is one of the landmarks of Skopje, a monumental building more than 385 m long. It was a part of a water-supply system with a total length of about 10 km. The age of the Aqueduct is not known – several hypotheses place it to periods between 6th and 16th century. Six mortar samples from different positions of the eastern façade and the upper parts with remains of tubes were collected in July 2017, paying attention that samples were not deteriorated and were situated at higher levels with less possibility of containing the secondary carbon. In the Laboratory, the maximum 5 cm of the mortar from the surface was subsampled, than broken by alternately changing temperatures from -198 °C to 80 °C. In order to extract only the carbon from the binder three strategies for separation of binder carbon were used: 1) mechanical separation of calcite inclusions formed during mortar hardening (not possible for all mortars), 2) selection on the basis of particle size and the ability to suspend in water induced by ultrasonic shock, and 3) collection of at least two fractions of CO₂ produced by reaction of calcite with acid. With the premise that all mortars originated from the same era, the results of ¹⁴C dating of each fraction were combined to yield a plausible date of the Aqueduct building. Some results were eliminated due to very low δ¹³C values combined with modern ¹⁴C dates and some implied dead carbon contamination. The most reliable results were obtained from two inclusions and one suspended fraction placing the time of the Aqueduct construction in 15-16 century AD. The analyses will be presented and possibility of using the method for future mortar dating will be discussed. References Hajdas et al. 2017.

Abstract: The RadiÖko Ltd. radioanalytical laboratory and Laboratory for low-level radioactivities of the Ruđer Bošković Institute (RBI) performed an interlaboratory comparison for the determination of H-3 and C-14 activities in water samples. Three samples were measured for H-3, two for C-14 activity. Each laboratory applied their own sample preparation techniques for H-3 determination and the activities were measured by LSC Quantulus 1220. At the RBI the low H-3 activity sample A was measured by both direct and electrolytic enrichment method. For the determination of the radiocarbon activity the Zagreb laboratory used AMS technique, whilst RadiÖko used an own developed sample oxizer followed by LSC measurement using a Quantulus LSC. It is interesting to note that all three H-3 results of the RadiÖko group are lower than those obtained at RBI. The results of the two radiocarbon measurements reveal that in the case of sample D the measurement results of the laboratories lie close to each other. Sample E had too high activity to be determined by AMS technique, this way it is not possible to compare the results. In all the successfully conducted cases it is apparent that the differences are well below the 10% satisfactory range

Word count: 3724
Similarity: 0.7616618
Abstract: Why is wage inflation so weak in spite of the recent sharp reduction in unemployment? We show that this may be due to an ongoing major positive labor supply shock. Indeed, the participation rate of workers aged between 55 and 64 has increased steadily over the last decade, from a third to above a half on average across OECD countries. This is most likely the consequence of aging and the reform of pensions. We show that the participation rate of workers aged 55 to 64 contributes to explain why wage inflation has remained weak over the last five years. For instance, it accounts for as much as -1% of wage inflation per annum in Germany since 2013. Our second result is that Phillips curves are alive and well. Wage inflation remains highly responsive to domestic unemployment rates, including after the Great Recession
Basic summary: The participation rates of the elderly have a significant negative effect on wage inflation for G7 countries, in the euro area and more broadly in the OECD. We show that the participation rate of workers aged 55 to 64 contributes to explain why wage inflation has remained weak over the last five years. As shown in the first column, wage inflation is highly responsive to its three traditional determinants: lagged CPI inflation, productivity and the unemployment rate. Rate differential above 55 - below 55 P. Rate differential above 55 - below 55 dP. What is less known, at least to inflation analysts, it that it has led to a tremendous increase in the participation of older workers to the labor market2. 6 standard backward looking wage Phillips curve (in the top panel) and the one augmented with the participation rate of workers ages 55 to 64 (in the bottom panel). Ceteris paribus, this positive labor supply shock is likely to push down wage inflation and unit labor costs. A one percent drop in the unemployment rate increases wage inflation by 0.5‐0.6% on average in the G7, 0.4% for the OECD and 0.25% in the euro area.

Abstract: Le Président de la Banque centrale européenne, M. Mario Draghi, a annoncé récemment que l’augmentation du taux directeur de la BCE interviendrait « bien après » la fin des mesures d’achats massifs de titres obligataires (prévue pour septembre 2018), principalement émis par les Etats de la zone euro, et à un « rythme mesuré ». La hausse du taux directeur pourrait donc intervenir vers la mi-2019, soit quelques semaines avant la passation de pouvoir entre Mario Draghi et son successeur. [Premier paragraphe
Basic summary: In a recent study, we also show that the two main determinants of inflation in the euro area are inflation expectations and wage growth. Une fois par trimestre un dialogue monétaire est organisé entre le Président de la BCE et les membres de la Commission des Affaires monétaires du Parlement européen. The ECB President has also been confident that companies are gradually anchoring their price (and wage) expectations on the ECB’s inflation target of 2% per year.

Similarity: 0.85404587
Abstract: Background: As a rare tumor, yolk sac tumor is a type of neoplasm that appears like the yolk sac, extraembryonic mesenchyme, and allantois. The mediastinum is the second most frequent area after the gonadal area. Case report: We present an extremely rare case of 15 years old boy with mediastinal yolk sac tumor. The boy came with the chief complaint of swelling of the neck and face. Computed tomography scan of the chest revealed bulky mass with a cystic component that infiltrated the heart. The diagnosis of mediastinal yolk sac tumor was made after core needle biopsy. Histopathologic analysis revealed tumor mass with solid and microcystic structure and pleomorphic nucleus within the tumor cells. Laboratory finding showed elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein level reaching more than 8000 ng/ml. Echocardiography revealed a mass in the right atrium. The patient condition was rapidly deteriorated due to his vena cava superior syndrome. Unfortunately, the patient died two days after diagnosis and we did not have the chance to do the therapy. Conclusion: Mediastinal yolk sac tumor is a rare malignancy that requires comprehensive management. The diagnosis should be made based on histopathological findings with the addition of thoracic computer tomography scan to assess the degree of infiltration to surrounding organ. A life-threatening condition such as vena cava superior syndrome should be assessed promptly to allow for immediate treatment
Basic summary: Our patient came with superior vena cava syn- drome so we performed radiotherapy to the tumor location to release compression of the tumor to the superior vena cava. However, the prognosis of primary mediastinal yolk sac tumor is poor and further research is needed to find the best treatment modality and regi- men for the tumor. In conclusion, primary mediastinal yolk sac tumor is an aggressive tumor that often invades and infiltrates surrounding structures and metastasis. Case report: We present an extremely rare case of 15 years old boy with mediastinal yolk sac tumor. Complete histologic response to chemotherapy in a patient with a mediastinal yolk sac tumor: a case report. Yolk sac tumor is nonseminomatous malignant GCTs that resembles yolk sac and extraembryonic mesenchyme . However, rare cases of mediastinal yolk sac tumor in 2 years old girl and 66 years old women were also reported [8, 9]. Primary mediastinal yolk sac tumor is classified as poor prognosis by the International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG) with the 5-year survival of 50% . Core needle biopsy was performed and diagnosis of mediastinal yolk sac tumor was made based on the histopathological finding. DISCUSSION We presented a case of yolk sac tumor in the anterior mediastinum of a 15 years old boy. Histopathologic analysis revealed tumor mass with solid and microcystic structure and pleomorphic nucleus within the tumor cells. The mediastinal yolk sac tumor diagnosis was made after we performed core needle biopsy. Uchiyama M, Iwafuchi M, Matsuda Y.

Abstract: Erwinia amylovora, a bacterial blight affecting fruit, is one of the most known and dangerous diseases affecting quince, pear and apple and other Rosaceae family plants. It was first discovered in America in 1780, and first appeared in Macedonian quinces in 1989. Erwinia amylovora, called bacterial blight of fruit trees and ornamental plants, is one of the most intensely pathogenic bacteria that have been studied. It is assumed that the disease was first recognised in the United States at the end of the 18th century in wild species of plants, from which the bacteria spread to sensitive varieties of pear (Pyrus communis), apple (Malus silvestris) and quince (Cydonia oblongata), introduced by early American settlers from Eastern Europe and Southwest Asia. Drying of fruit trees was first observed in mountainous areas on both sides of the Hudson River in New York. From this region, the bacteria spread at high speed to neighbouring countries
Basic summary: Erwinia amylovora, called bacterial blight of fruit trees and ornamental plants, is one of the most intensely pathogenic bacteria that have been studied. 7 Erwinia amylovora - bacterial blight of quince, pears and apples Quince (Cydonia oblonga) belongs to the genus Cydonia, subfamily Pomoidae and family Rosaceae. The bacterial blight disease is the most harmful for pears, apples, quince and other plants of the family Rosaceae. In Mexico, the disease was first reported in 1921, and in 1943 was observed in pear and apple trees (Bonn & Van der Zwet, 2000). The first is the ability of bacteria to multiply on the surface of plants without causing disease (Thomson, 2000).  , bacterial blight on apple, pear and quince 7 2.

These benefits are raised up using financial tools so the need of promoting financial inclusion is more than obvious - it is global priority. Financial infrastructure can help in reducing the risks and increase the efficiency of financial markets, but can sometimes contribute to situations where excessive risks are being taken. Financial infrastructure could be considered as a system of roads under which financial intermediation takes place. Better roads reduce travel time and costs, but also increase the potential speed, which has inherent risks. These benefits are raised up using financial tools so the need of promoting financial inclusion is more than obvious, it is global priority. This paper examines that financial developments expand economic opportunity which create positive effects as theory and evidences provide sound reasons for taking this benefits

Abstract: The length of stay of healthy term newborn should be based on the unique characteristics of each mother/infant dyad, including health and stability of the mother/infant, and the confidence of the mother to care for her infant. The length of hospital stays following normal term delivery has decreased dramatically over the past few decades and early discharge is considered shorter than 48 hours after birth.  The aim of this study was to assess the dyad mother/baby before the discharge in order to reduce the risks of adverse events including neonatal readmission rates, neonatal mortality rates and emergency room visits.  Material and methods: CUSCWBEM score (acronym for color, urine, stool, color, weight, breasts and maternal emotions) was performed after obtaining informed consent from the mother. 148 pairs mother/baby from the University Clinic for Gynecology and Obstetrics in Skopje, Macedonia, were examined using CUSCWBEM score forms, containing 10 items, on the second day, while both, mother and baby were settled well.. As affirmative for discharge was a score of 8 and more points.  Results: 106 pairs mother/baby passed the assessment and considered prepared for discharge (it is 71,6%). Those who have failed the assessment mainly was for mild cyanosis (2%), jaundice (6,1%), unsatisfactory weight (2,5%), breast problems in mother (3,1%), maternal emotions, low bonding and unpreparedness (5%) and the rest had combination of two and more indicators. Those pairs were not considered for discharge in 48 hours.  Conclusion: bonding is a vital component of the attachment process as a measure for prevention of physical, emotional and social impairments through the life course. Other elements of the wellbeing are essential as well. Therefore, thorough postpartum assessment is key measure in prevention of adverse events after the early discharge, as this model was proven effective for the transition and cost-effective for the health system.  \u

Abstract: Procurement of materials and spare parts for the needs of the companies is often a major source of problems for the quality of products and services. This paper shows the results of a larger study of Macedonian companies in terms of planning and implementing the philosophy of Total Quality Management (TQM) and building partnerships with suppliers. The survey results indicate the fact that many of the companies in Macedonia build formal relationship with suppliers that do not deliver the desired results. When there is poor quality of the raw materials, good quality of product is not expected, therefore consistency on the market is not achieved and the requirements of ISO standards are not met. To achieve sustainable development, Macedonian companies need to eliminate old habits and proactively focus on developing long-term partnerships with suppliers, providing technical support for training to improve processes, product quality, productivity, in one word accepting the TQM philosophy.\u
Basic summary: Quality of the products depends on the quality of raw materials provided by the supplier, therefore building a partnership with the supplier is necessary. QUALITY MANAGEMENT 45 only formal business relationships with suppliers without willing to essentially improve these relations or to define the obligations and responsibilities and to improve the quality. Actions such as timely delivery of raw materials without defects can greatly improve the quality of the products as “first step” to provide good quality of products and services. Suppliers are key link in the planning and implementation of TQM (Total Quality Management) system and they play an important role for effective and efficient quality system. The Supplier Relationship Management in Macedonian companies Management of suppliers is an important aspect of the quality system.

Title: Strategies in Managing Rapport in Classroom Discussion
Word count: 3612
Similarity: 0.8024409
Abstract: This paper aims to find out the strategies, applied by students in classroom interaction particularly in discussion, to maintain their interpersonal rapport as well as to enhance their rapport management with their fellow students. There are five strategies based on Spencer-Oatey (2008) that the interactants apply in social interactions. The strategies are request, compliments, apologies, gratitude and disagreement. The research is done to see whether the students realize the management of rapport in social interaction and their strategies that they would apply in classroom discussion. The research is done by using descriptive qualitative method to identify the students\u27 strategies in maintaining their interpersonal rapport and enhancing the rapport management with their fellow students. The data was obtained by video-recording the interactions of the students during the classroom discussions and by giving the students some questionnaires. The researcher also applied the participant observation to see the students reactions during the discussion considering that the strategies that the students apply may bring about the rapport threat and enhancement which are subjective evaluations, which depend not simply on the content of the message, but on people\u27s interpretations and reactions to who says what under what circumstances. The research indicates that the students\u27 mostly applied strategy is disagremeent and the type of the disagreement is token agreement. In other words, the students tend to hold the rapport enhancement behavior since in expressing their disagreement, they initially expressed their agreement as a token of appreciation.Keywords:classroom discussion, interpersonal rapport, rapport management,&nbsp; rapport orientatio

Title: Floral Stimulation and Behavior of Insect Pollinators Affected by Pyraclostrobin on Arabica Coffee
Word count: 2396
Similarity: 0.92797667
Abstract: Coffee is the most valuable traded commodity after oil. On coffee, bees act to support a pollination that is shown by the number of harvested berries. This research aimed to evaluate the use of pyraclostrobin on flowering stage and insect pollinators on Arabica Coffee. Experiment was conducted in Kalisat Coffee Farm, Jampit, Bondowoso, ca. 1600 meters after sea level from October 2013 to April 2014. Randomized Block Design was adopted in this experiment. Three doses of pyraclostrobin and control were used as treatments such as 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 cc L-1 of pyraclostrobin, and repeated three times. Percentage of fallen flower, fruiting stage, fruit production, frequency of bee`s visitation, and bee`s behavior was observed as variables in this experiment. Results showed that 1) percentage of fallen flowers was reduced by applying pyraclostrobin at 1.5 and 2.0 cc L-1 up to 50 % compared to control, 2) flowering rate was faster than control at 1.5 and 2.0 cc L-1 of pyraclostrobin, 3) application of 1.5 – 2.0 cc L-1 of pyraclostrobin increased the number of young fruits and pinheads, and 4) pollinators preferred to visit flowers of coffee trees which sprayed by pyraclostrobin than control treatment especially Apis mellifera
Basic summary: Considering pyraclostrobin benefits and the important value of coffee, it is important to evaluate the effect of pyraclostrobin on flowering and insect pollinators of arabica coffee. Pyraclostrobin plays a role to stimulate the number of flower on coffee and the number of flowers can stimulate and increase the intensity of bee’s visit. Based on total average number of flowers, application of pyraclostrobin at 1.5 and 2.0 cc L-1 enhances flowering rate of arabica coffee starting from 2nd to 3rd application (Fig. : Evaluation of Pyraclostrobin on Coffee Flowering Stage................................................................... 163 Based on insect pollinator variable, Apis mellifera prefers to visit trees which are sprayed by pyraclostrobin Fig. This research aimed to evaluate the use of pyraclostrobin on flowering stage and insect pollinators on Arabica Coffee.

Title: Tectonic Model of Bali Island Inferred From GPS Data
Word count: 3817
Similarity: 0.93747425
Abstract: DOI: 10.17014/ijog.5.1.81-91Seven periods of GPS campaign have been conducted for three years since March 2013 - October 2015 on fourteen GPS sites across Bali Island. The GAMIT/GLOBK 10.6 version was used to compute data with respect for thirteen reference sites of International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) 2008 surrounding Bali. The result shows that horizontal displacement varies between 1.93 and 22.53 mm/yr dominantly northeastward. Vertical displacement ranges at -184.34 to 33.79 mm/yr. The result of modeling using Coulomb 3.3 version indicates the deformation in Bali was mostly contributed by subduction at the southern part, West and East Flores Back-Arc Thrust at the north, Lombok Strait Fault and a fault at the eastern coast of Bali with the estimation maximum magnitude of 7.1, 6.6, 6.8, 5.8, and 5.2, respectively
Basic summary: Furthermore, in order to find the best fit model of the earthquake source to the available velocity data, the Coulomb 3.3 software (Toda et al., 2011) was performed. The five source models produce GPS velocity at 0.81 mm/yr to 13.51 mm/ yr northeastward (Figure 8). From the time series of position changes, the velocity vector value of each GPS movement site can be estimated using the least square method. Another earthquake source which affected Bali originates from Flores Back-Arc Thrust extend- ing from the north of Bali on the west and East Nusa Tenggara on the east side. GPS Survey And Analysis GPS survey is a method which is often used to analyze deformation associated with crustal fault activities by observing the displacement pattern.

Title: Pollution and Foraging Behavior of Pied Kingfisher Ceryle rudis in Bujumbura Bay of Lake Tanganyika, Burundi: Conservation Implications
Word count: 2809
Similarity: 0.763354
Abstract: Lake Tanganyika is threatened by overfishing, deforestation, climate change and water pollution. Very few studies have investigated the effects of pollution on semi-aquatic communities such as aquatic birds. This study investigates the effects of pollution on the foraging behavior of pied Kingfisher Ceryle rudis in the Bujumbura bay of Lake Tanganyika. We use data on foraging behavior of this bird species collected in 2002 as background and data collected over two periods during which we assessed change in water environmental parameters. The sampling site is located in the littoral zone next to the channel mouths that collect rainfall and wastewater from Bujumbura city. The results show a change in the number of observations of foraging pied kingfishers during the course of the day with a significantly lower number of observations in the morning than in the study carried out in 2002. The most frequent foraging behavior also changed from direct dives in 2002 to repeated hovering before diving in 2016. These changes could be accounted for by pollution as the water parameters data collected during the same time periods reveal an increase in turbidity while dissolved oxygen levels dropped. Increased turbidity may have caused reduction of visibility of these visual predatory birds. Attention should be given to measures toward alleviation of pollution of Lake Tanganyika for the conservation of semi-aquatic communities which are members of this deep and ancient lake ecosystem
Basic summary: Another study conducted at our study site showed that there was a significant pollution by nutrient loads from water collectors discharging into the lake (Ndikumana et al. Like the change in foraging timing, this change in foraging behavior could be explained by the increase in turbidity of the water at the study site. We recorded the number of observations of pied kingfishers, time of the observations and foraging behaviors namely single hovering, repeated hovering prior to dive and direct dive without hovering. Our study suggests that despite the detrimental effect of pollution on the ecology and behavior of pied kingfisher, the study site still offers a foraging habitat for this species. Pied kingfishers fishing behavior differed from our study and the study carried out by Hakizimana et al. Our study shows that foraging behavior of pied kingfisher at littoral zone of Lake Tanganyika near Bujumbura city may have been affected by pollution. The reduced number of observations of foraging pied kingfishers in our study site may have resulted from reduced visibility. This study investigates the effects of pollution on the foraging behavior of pied Kingfisher Ceryle rudis in the Bujumbura bay of Lake Tanganyika. In this study we investigate the effect of pollution on the foraging behavior of pied Kingfisher in the Bujumbura bay of Lake Tanganyika. 2.2 Data collection This study is based on the comparison of our results with data collected by Hakizimana et al.

Title: Estimated carbon stored on some landscape forests in South East Sulawesi
Word count: 2104
Similarity: 0.8238016
Abstract: Carbon stored in several forest landscapes in Southeast Sulawesi such as the Jati stand on the People\u27s Forest, Pine stands in Protected Forest, Mangrove Forest vegetation, Natural vegetation of urban forest, and Campus Forest show the weight of carbon stored per hectare different from one vegetation to another. The objective of this research is to know the biomass and the amount of carbon stored up (levels of the tree, pole, stakes), the lower plants, litter and nekromassa in various forest landscape in Southeast Sulawesi. Biomass is obtained through the use of allometric equations (plants on the surface), and measures the wet weight and dry weight (bottom plants, woody necromassa and non-woody). Furthermore, the estimated amount of carbon stored. The results showed Pinus stand (Pinus mercusii) carbon stored 65,992 tons ha-1, stand Teak (Tectona grandis) 36.213 tons ha-1, Mangrove vegetation (Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Lumnitzera racemosa, Rhizophora sp, Sonneratia alba, and Avicennia alba) 68.12 tons ha-1, natural vegetation Forest City 50.01 tons ha-1,  natural vegetation Forest Campus 98.18 tons ha-1. The availability of carbon estimation information in various forest landscapes can be used as supporting data for REDD + programs aimed at addressing climate issues
Basic summary: In addition, mangrove vegetation with tidal habitats (tidal vegetation), although a natural vegetation but has a lower amount of carbon stored than in the natural vegetation habitat on land. Carbon stored in plants will be higher, as the age of the plant increases. INTRODUCTION Forest landscape is a description of land cover both within forest area and outside forest area in the form of forest and non forest. 4.3 Natural Vegetation in Campus Forests Haluoleo University Campus Forest is a natural vegetation located within the campus in Kecamatan Kambu Kendari with an area of 58.96 Ha. Natural vegetation of mixed species also tends to have higher amounts of stored carbon than vegetation consisting of only one type of constituent. 4.5 Carbon Stored in Mangrove Forest The area of mangrove forest in Latompa Village, Maligano Sub-district, Muna Regency, Southeast Sulawesi Province 160 Ha.

Title: Evaluation of Groundwater Prospect in a Clay Dominated Environment of Central Kwara State, Southwestern Nigeria
Word count: 2555
Similarity: 0.8710264
Abstract: In this research, groundwater prospect of Central Kwara have been investigated using electrical resistivity method for both domestic and industrial application in the face of scarce water resources, occasioned by incessant borehole failure/low yield, has prompted researches for viable source of water. The central Kwara state falls within the basement complex region of Nigeria known as the hard rock terrain, where availability of groundwater is dependent mainly on structural features. The general curve types obtained from the study area were H, HA, KH and HKH types with the H curve type more prominent in the study area. Three geoelectric sections generated with resistivity parameters ranging between 350 to 1900 ohm-meters, 7.7 to 99.1 ohm-meter and above 3000 ohm-meter; making up the topsoil, weathered layer and bedrock respectively. The topsoil is interpreted as laterite/hard pan within thickness range of 0.4 and 2.2 m while the weathered layer zone ranged between 0.9 to 36.1 m thickness respectively; making the overburden of the area with thickness range of 1.4 to 42.7 m. The bedrock resistivity ranges from 400 ohm-meter to 8192 ohm-meter, indicative of weathered/fractured and fresh basement respectively. The results of the vertical electrical sounding were used to generate clay horizon resistivity map, clay horizon thickness map, aquifer resistivity map and overburden thickness map. This study reveals that the study area is dominated by clay which lead to borehole failure and dry up of hand pump well because most of the hand pump well were terminated within the clayey formation
Basic summary: The results of the vertical electrical sounding were used to generate clay horizon resistivity map, clay horizon thickness map, aquifer resistivity map and overburden thickness map. The aquifer of the entire area is good expected for the region of low aquifer resistivity due to the existence of thick clay within the study area. Overburden Thickness Map Figure 9 displays the overburden thickness map which shows the variation in overburden of the study area, from the topsoil down to the fresh bedrock. While the rest of the study area is characterized by moderate aquifer resistivity and a little pocket of the northwestern end has a high aquifer resistivity. Keywords— clay horizon resistivity, clay horizon thickness, aquifer resistivity, overburden thickness. Implication to the study implies moderate aquifer protection and cause low groundwater prospect around the study area. The general curve types obtained from the study area were H, HA, KH and HKH types with the H curve type more prominent in the study area.

Title: Consumers’ Food Value Attributes on Ghana’s Local Market; Case Study of Berekum Municipality
Word count: 2458
Similarity: 0.62093127
Abstract: This paper investigates consumers\u27 price perceptions at Ghana\u27s local markets. By analyzing the questionnaire survey results, it identifies the relative importance local customers placed on weights and measures in comparison to other food attributes in purchasing agricultural products. In determining customers\u27 decision-making behaviors, we applied Kahneman\u27s (2012) prospect theory and developed picture-based scenarios for the customers to express their value perceptions at the market. We also asked questions to see what food attributes are important for them. We wanted to find out if such attributes as weights and measures are important for local Ghanaian customers other than more well-recognized ones such as food quality and price. The results indicate that our respondents decide to buy agricultural products like vegetables, eggs, and rice, on the basis of four attributes: (1) weights and measures, (2) health values, (3) safety, and (4) affordability. As previous studies on Western consumers tend to show high importance on food quality, our results suggest that customers\u27 choices may differ more likely by socio-cultural backgrounds. This conclusion can be buttressed by another part of our survey that shows that our respondents are mostly middle-class, educated nuclear families in this region. About 80percent of them agreed that traditionally prescribed weights and measures were important to understand the value of agricultural products at the market
Basic summary: A consumer survey was conducted to clarify food attributes that influence consumers’ purchasing decisions and to investigate if weights and measures influence their purchasing behaviors. By analyzing the questionnaire survey results, it identifies the relative importance local customers placed on weights and measures in comparison to other food attributes in purchasing agricultural products. Some questions meant to identify consumers’ perceptions about food product value attributes to determine the importance of weight and measure. We wanted to find out if such attributes as weights and measures are important for local Ghanaian customers other than more well-recognized ones such as food quality and price. As previous studies on Western consumers tend to show high importance on food quality, our results suggest that customers’ choices may differ more likely by socio-cultural backgrounds. The study also found that food values are significantly influenced by consumers’ traditional perceptions on product values. However, studies on consumer behaviors toward food products have focused mostly on such product quality cues as freshness, taste, health values, and origin, for purchasing. These results suggest that consumers at the Berekum market largely prefer the use of standardized measure, either traditional or conventional forms, in purchasing vegetables. CONCLUSION This survey attempted to better understand the extent to which weights and measures are key factors in determining consumers’ purchasing behaviors.

Abstract: This study covers proximate analysis and Antimicrobial activities of cell free extract of lactic acid bacterial from Blighia sapida fruit (Ackee). The proximate analysis of Blighia sapida were determined using standard methods which varied in contents. The proximate analysis of the sample were ash content (6.10±0.03%), moisture content (5.43±0.12%), fat content (14.60±0.02%), crude fibre content (25.12±0.02%), protein content (14.19±0.09%) and carbohydrate content (34.19±0.23%). Probiotic of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Blighia sapida (Ackee) were identified as Lactobacillus leshmanni, and Lactobacillus acidophilus, with Streptomycin sulphate as control. Antimicrobial activities of the lactic acid isolated were determined by the agar well diffusion methods against pathogenic bacteria: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Xanthomonas sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi and Bacillus subtilis. The zone of inhibition ranged from 3mm to 25mm and control ranged from 23mm to 30mm. Lactobacillus acidophilus displayed high antimicrobial activity compared with Lactobacillus leshmanni showing its probiotic potential of lactic acid bacteria use for food supplement
Basic summary: The proximate analysis of the sample were ash content (6.10±0.03%), moisture content (5.43±0.12%), fat content (14.60±0.02%), crude fibre content (25.12±0.02%), protein content (14.19±0.09%) and carbohydrate content (34.19±0.23%). The Lactobacillus leschmanni and Lactobacillus acidophilus of lactic acid bacteria inhibited the growth of test organisms and control had higher inhibition between 23 mm - 30 mm. It has higher values 3 mm - 25 mm than the report obtained for the inhibition value of Mango pulp (2.64 mm) (Ravi et al., 2011). CONCLUSION The lactic acid bacteria isolated from Blighia sapida fruit had high inhibition of pathogenic bacteria. Probiotic of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Blighia sapida (Ackee) were identified as Lactobacillus leshmanni, and Lactobacillus acidophilus, with Streptomycin sulphate as control. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The moisture content of Blighia sapida (5.43±0.12%) was low compared to that of Fallon et al., (2014) who reported (8.39±0.25%) for tree-ripened Ackee. Fat content of (14.60±0.02%) is considered similar to (14.0±0.60%) reported for tree ripened Blighia sapida (Fallon et al., 2014).

Abstract: Waste is one of factors causing air pollution in Palembang City. Volume of waste that should be processed increases every day, while condition of waste management service is still 70% of the total volume. The waste processing is managed by using open dumping system, which affects on the increase of air pollution. One of gases that exist as effect of the process of organic compound decomposition of anaerobic bacteria from garbage is sulfide hydrogen (H2S) pollutant which can promote health disorders, especially respiratory system. This study aimed to analyze correlation between characteristics (age, sex, nutritional status, smoking, and living distance) and the risk quotient of sulfide hydrogen concentration in air ambient to the lung capacity of people around landfillarea. This study used cross-sectional design with the sample of 78 people around landfill area. Data analysis used double logistic regression. Results showed that nutritional status (p value = 0.022, OR = 12.085) and RQ (p value = 0.016; OR = 7.547) significantly related to lung vital capacity of people around landfill area. People around landfill area having worse nutrition and lower RQ than the median were potential to have lung vital capacity disorder. The dominant variable significantly influencing to lung vital capacity of people living around Sukawinatan Landfill is nutritional status.Sampah merupakan salah satu penyebab terjadinya polusi udara di Kota Palembang. Setiap hari terjadi peningkatan volume sampah yang harus diolah, sedangkan kondisi pelayanan pengelolaan sampah baru mencapai sekitar 70% dari total sampah secara keseluruhan. Pengolahan sampah yang dilakukan menggunakan sistem open dumping berdampak terhadap peningkatan terjadinya polusi udara. Gas hidrogen sulfida (H2S) yang diperoleh dari proses penguraian senyawa organik oleh bakteri anaerob pada tumpukan sampah dapat mengganggu kesehatan, terutama sistem pernapasan. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk menganalisis hubungan antara karakteristik (usia, jenis kelamin, status gizi, merokok, dan jarak tempat tinggal) dan besaran risiko konsentrasi H2S udara ambien terhadap kapasitas vital paru penduduk di sekitar tempat pembuangan akhir (TPA) sampah. Penelitian ini menggunakan desain potong lintang dengan sampel 78 orang penduduk yang berada di sekitar TPA. Analisis data menggunakan uji regresi logistik ganda. Hasil menunjukkan nilai status gizi (nilai p = 0,022, OR = 12,085) dan RQ (nilai p = 0,016; OR = 7,547) berhubungan secara signifikan terhadap kapasitas vital paru penduduk yang berada di sekitar TPA. Penduduk yang berada di sekitar TPA dengan nilai status gizi buruk dan nilai RQ lebih rendah dari median berpotensi mengalami gangguan kapasitas vital paru. Variabel dominan yang secara signifikan memengaruhi kapasitas vital paru penduduk yang berada di sekitar TPA sampah Sukawintan adalah status gizi
Basic summary: It means that people living around Sukawinatan Landfill with bad nutritional status had risks to have lung vital capacity disorder 12.085 times more than those with good nutitional status. Lung vital capacity was obtained by measuring Forced Vital Capacity, Prediction Forced Vital Capacity, and Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (Forced Exhale Vital 1). This means that people with bad nutritional status had 11.63 times more chances to have lung vital capacity dis- order than those with good nutritional status. Nutritional status had OR 12.085, meaning that people with bad nutrition had 12 times more chances to have lung vital capacity than those with good nutritional status. It means that the people living around Sukawinatan Landfill that had RQ more than median (≥ 45.50) were 99.18% and those people would have lung vital capacity disorder. The people living around Sukawinatan Landfill that had RQ greater than median (≥ 45.50) were 99.18% and those people would have lung vital capacity disorder. The domi- nant variable significantly influencing to lung vital capacity of people living around Sukawinatan Landfill is nutritional status. It can be concluded that people living around Sukawinatan Landfill with RQ more than median (≥ 45.50) had the risk 7.55 times more to have lung vital capacity disorder. The pro- bability percentage of people with bad nutritional status to have lung vital capacity disorder was 92%. People around landfill area having worse nutrition and lower RQ than the median were potential to have lung vital capacity disorder. People’s nutritional status can influence the lung vital capacity. The dominant variable that influences significantly to lung vital capaci- ty of people living around Sukawinatan Landfill was nu- tritional status (OR= 12.09). Keywords: Air pollution, lung vital capacity, nutritional status Abstrak Sampah merupakan salah satu penyebab terjadinya polusi udara di Kota Palembang. From the results, it can be concluded that there was a significant correla- tion between RQ and the lung vital capacity of people li- ving around Sukawinatan Landfill.

By using descriptive qualitative method, this study aimed to answer the following questions. The first research question is about the characters of Dexter Morgan, and the second research question is about how he conceals himself from the society. By using theories from Robert Hare\u27s Psychopathy Checklist –Revised (PCL- R) and Hervey M. Cleckley\u27sThe Mask of Sanity, the questions are answered in a direct way. The results of the study showed that Dexter Morgan matches 19 from 20 of PCL- R traits from both two factors (Personality and Behavior) such as charming personality, grandiose of self-worth, proneness to boredom, liar, manipulative, lack of remorse, shallow affect, poor and early behavioral problems, promiscuous sexual behavior, lack of realistic goals, impulsive, irresponsible, cannot accept responsibility, short-term relationship, juvenile delinquency, and criminal versatility. The only exception in the trait is from second factor which is revocation of conditional release, because Dexter Morgan never got caught, so he does not need to escape or bail from restraining orders.The result of the second research question showed how psychopath or sociopath lurking around in our peaceful society filled with happiness and joys by faking a smile and superficial charming personality. Psychopath conceals themselves in our everyday lives. Based on the answers of research questions, Dexter Morgan has dominant character as a high functioning psychopath because he can manipulate everyone, undetected serial killer, and act like a wolf in sheep clothes.Dexter Morgan adalah seorang ahli dalam memanipulasi kehidupan dan juga seorang kriminal tak terdeteksi. Dengan menggunakan metode deskriptif kualitatif, penilitian ini bertujuan untuk menjawab pertanyaan sebagai berikut. Pertanyaan pertama adalah tentang karakter dari Dexter Morgan, dan yang kedua adalah tentang bagaimana Dexter Morgan menyembunyikan identitas dirinya yang sebenarnya di kehidupan sosial. Dengan menggunakan teori dari Robert Hare yang bernama Psychopathy Checklist – Revised (PCL –R) dan Harvey M.Cleckley yang berjudul The Mask of Sanity. Hasil dari penilitian ini adalah Dexter Morgan mampu membuktikan bahwa ia sangat fit dengan 19 dari 20 kriteria PCL –R dari kedua faktor (Kepribadian dan Kebiasaan) seperti kepribadian yang mempesona, kebanggaan berlebihan terhadap diri sendiri, cepat bosan, pembohong, manipulatif, kurangnya perasaan menyesal, kosong, mempunyai masalah kebiasaan sejak dini, kebiasaan seksual yang acak, kurangnya tujuan realistis, bertindak tanpa berfikir, tidak bertanggung jawab, tidak bisa menanggung tanggung jawab terhadap diri sendiri, hubungan jangka pendek, dan lain sebagainya. Satu-satunya kriteria yang tidak dipenuhi Dexter Morgan adalah pembebasan dengan syarat tertentu, karena Dexter Morgan tidak pernah tertangkap oleh pihak berwajib, ia tidak perlu di bebaskan dengan syarat. Sedangkan jawaban dari pertanyaan kedua adalah bagaimana seorang psikopat atau sosiopat menguntit dalam kehidupan sehari-hari kita menggunakan senyuman palsu dan juga keahlian untuk memanipulasi kerabat atau teman-teman di kehidupan sosial.  Berdasarkan jawaban dari kedua pertanyaan, Dexter Morgan sangat dominan dengan sifat psikopat dalam dirinya sehingga ini membuat ia adalah psikopat berkemampuan tinggi, ia hebat memanipulasi dan juga pembunuh tak terdeteksi, ia adalah serigala dalam jubah domba

Title: Improve Performance of FLASE Alarm Detection by using CFAR and Low Pass Filter
Word count: 2241
Similarity: 0.9180566
Abstract: Cyber &ndash;Physical System (CPS) is an integration of physical systems with computation, communication and controlling. CPS has various applications such as power networks, transportation networks, healthcare applications, infrastructures and industrial process. CPS connects the virtual world with the physical world. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are the vital part of CPS because they have the strong sensing capabilities. In CPS healthcare application various sensors are used to collect the data from patients. Many times these sensors generate a large number of false alarms. Due to these false alarms confusion is created and it reduces the efficiency of overall healthcare services. There are still a lot of challenges in healthcare such as intoperability, security and privacy, autonomy and device verifiability. In this paper, we improve the performance of false alarm detection by using CFAR (constant false alarm rate) and the low pass filter. Thus we are using low pass filter here because our actual values will be present in the lower frequency region. The noise has higher frequency thus we tend to remove them by using a low pass filter
Basic summary: In this paper, we use the CFAR (constant false alarm rate) and low pass filter (trapz filter).By using this low pass filter we get only actual alarms. In this paper, we improve the performance of false alarm detection by using CFAR (constant false alarm rate) and the low pass filter. Thus we are using low pass filter here because our actual values will be present in the lower frequency region. Most radar-detectors, threshold is situated with a specific end goal to accomplish an obliged probability of false alarm (or comparably, false rate alarm or the time in between false-alarms. So that means as the SNR (signal to noise ratio) get increase the Probability of false alarm detection get low. Proposed False Alarm Detection Architecture:- The proposed architecture in CPS healthcare application integrates physical and virtual systems by sensing, computation and communication. According to previous work probability of detection is low, that means system is not able to detect false alarm and it is passing to the receiver. In low pass filter the noise signals (high frequency signals) are rejected and the signals with low frequency are passes. In CPS healthcare application, various type of medical sensors are used, however these sensors produce a larger than average mixture of false alerts. By the proposed system PD is getting increase and the PFA is decreasing that means system is more perfect to detect false alarm system. CFAR and low pass filter are able to detect more False alarms The Value of PD get increase according to the proposed methodology.

Title: Checklist of Flora Along Tourist Trails to Mt. Lamongan, East Java (Indonesia): Misconception of Restoration and Ecotourism Programs in Mountain Region?
Word count: 4365
Similarity: 0.8955649
Abstract: The aim of this research was to evaluate the diversity of plant species along the tourist trails to Mt. Lamongan and combat any misconceptions about ecosystem restoration and the ecotourism development program in Mt. Lamongan. A floristic survey was done through flora identification along the hiking trail from the gate of Mt. Lamongan nature recreation area in Papringan Village to the slopes of Mt. Lamongan. The identified species were listed and their taxonomic status analyzed using information from the GRIN website. This study found that exotic plant species are abundant along the tourist tract. Human activities were identified as contributing to the introduction and establishment of exotic plant species. Result of the research indicate that restoration knowledge and techniques do not exist in the Mt. Lamongan region. A comprehensive evaluation of flora should be implemented to enhance the restoration program and protect forest area, especially the tourist corridor to the peak of Mt. Lamongan. Integrated actions to enhance restoration and promote tourism are needed. It encompasses strengthening the restoration concept and technology, eradication of exotic plant species, and establishing a proper tourism interpretive tract
Basic summary: The families with the highest number of species were Fabaceae (18 species), Asteraceae (12 species), Poaceae (13 species), and Euphorbiaceae (7 species). Eradication of exotic plant species Eradication of exotic plant species is crucial in the restoration program (Myers et al., 2000). Valuable species The exotic plants in valuable plant species can be classified into fruit, vegetable, wood and other economic trees species. Exotic plant species This survey found numerous non native plant species in the Mt. Exotic plant species specific to the particular regions and ecosystem are often related to the number of programs, including land rehabilitation, ecosystem restoration and tourism site improvement. Exotic plant species in the restoration project area in Ranupani recreation forest, Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park (Indonesia). These exotic plant species basically can be classified as valuable plant species and weeds. The crucial programs include (1) strengthening the restoration concept and technology, (2) eradication of exotic plant species, and (3) establishing proper tourism interpretive tracts. By considering the list of plant species, it seems that economic considerations are dominant in selection of species to introduce in degraded areas at Mt. (1972), to date there are no intensive studies focusing on mountain flora databases, especially on exotic plant species in mountain areas. The number of native lower mountain plant species was extremely low, and the agroforestry area was dominated by plants with economic value. We studied flora species diversity along the tourist trails covered with shrubs, grassland, and a small patch of secondary forest. It encompasses strengthening the restoration concept and technology, eradication of exotic plant species, and establishing a proper tourism interpretive tract. Some recently appearing secondary forest patches along the hiking trail corridor area in the past contained few valuable woody tree species and useful plants. While some species are able to be use as animal feed, only a few species were Checklist of flora along tourist trails to Mt.

Title: Analysis of Elastic Recovery in The Process of Bending Sheets of Duplex Steel SAF 2205 via Experimental Method and Numerical Simulation
Word count: 2904
Similarity: 0.91043484
Abstract: The mechanical conformation is widely used in metal materials manufacture, being the bending process one of the most applied in the metal-mechanical industry. The material behavior analysis is important in this kind of process, since fabrication problems can compromise the final performance of bent components. During the bending process of metal sheets, the sheet undergoes a geometric variation after the withdrawal of the load. This effect, as known as elastic recovery, can be harmful when it is needed to fit two components with low tolerances. The comparative between elastic recovery problem analyses in folded sheets by numerical simulation and the experimental method seeks to anticipate possible inconveniences and additional costs during the try out tests. The numerical results are compared with the experimental laboratory tests. The contact and the interaction between the tool components and the sample boundary conditions are evaluated. Thereby, we consider the aspects necessary for modeling the elastic recovery in agreement with the experimental test, obtaining a very close result between the two methods
Basic summary: 1: Main parameters in sheet bending The elastic recovery and the tooling involved in the manufacture of bending parts are important concern in the final dimension components design. The present work evaluates the comparative elastic recovery of the experimental process using the mathematical modeling ABAQUS/CAE 2017 software of stainless steel SAF 2205 in V bending. Similar to the previous data, the SAF 2205TT steel maintained the same tendency to increase the elastic recovery as the bending radius was increased. The elastic recovery phenomenon became clearer for the SAF 2205 material as received in both situations, numerical and experimental tests. It was verified that the increase in the bending radius raised the elastic recovery angle for both materials. Several methods have been proposed to quantify or evaluate the elastic recovery of metals in sheet bending. The elastic recovery phenomenon increased with the puncture radius and with the variation of the material properties. The influence of the bending parameters on the elastic recovery phenomenon is an expected fact.

Title: Analysis of Public Transport System, Hatay Example: Detection of Existing System
Word count: 3374
Similarity: 0.97499824
Abstract: Today, with the development of our cities, the population density has increased and therefore many problems have arisen due to the increase of the traffic density in the city and the existing transportation systems which were previously not planned with erroneous technical infrastructure have become unable to answer. Measurements of the decision variables related to the routes, vehicles and passengers are made in order to determine the existing public transport system. These decision variables include the number of vehicles leaving service during the day, the passenger carrying capacity of the vehicles, the starting and ending times of the laps, the length of the public transport line, the number of laps made during the day, the number of passengers per vehicle, and the total number of passengers. By using these variables, the structure of the existing public transportation system is determined. Increasing the quality of public transport services in metropolitan cities and raising the quality of users in more economical conditions is only possible by incorporating business activities into an institutional structure, integrating public transportation enterprises into one and planning and managing them in a unified way. Our aim in this study is to evaluate the existing route structures, vehicle types and travel analyzes in the public transportation system in Hatay Province and evaluate the positive and negative points in the developing urban structure and to transform them into an effective and sustainable structure
Basic summary: Number Of Passengers Per Kilometer One way of evaluating the number of passengers and thus their income is the number of passengers carried per kilometer. Number of Tours per Vehicle Due to the high number of vehicles on the line, the number of tours the vehicles make during the day is low. Km Per Vehicle One of the most important indicators of productivity in public transport operators is the km values the vehicles make during the day. In other words, most of the vehicles that provide public transport services are made up of old vehicles that have completed their economic life. Measurements of the decision variables related to the routes, vehicles and passengers are made in order to determine the existing public transport system. The fact that the vehicles that provide public transport in the city have a low capacity during the day shows that there is an idle capacity.

Similarity: 0.70965815
Abstract: With changes of lifestyles and social values in the food culture, many individuals working as managerial level employees in the as private sector are seemingly selecting more improper daily meal combinations. This study was designed to determine whether this occurrence can have a severe impact to imbalance the daily nutrient intakes by the individuals in the mentioned social segment, which increase the tendency of having nutrition related chronic diseases. In a hierarchy range from junior executives to CEOs of private sector organizations, 800 individuals were selected by disproportionate stratified random sampling. Selected individuals are interviewed using a structured questionnaire to assess their daily food combinations and their consumed portion sizes. Frequently consumed meal combinations were then analyzed for their macronutrient composition, to compare with world Health organizations&rsquo; (WHO) Reference Dietary Intake (RDI) levels of nutrients. The results reveal of significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher daily fat (45.3 &plusmn;1.7 g/day) and protein (65.2 &plusmn;1.4 g/day) intakes than the WHO recommendation levels and significantly (p&lt;0.05) lower in dietary fibre (22.3 &plusmn;1.1 g/day) contents by selected participants. Carbohydrate intake (133.1 &plusmn;2.2 g/day) was higher than reference levels but was not significant (p&gt;0.05). This indicates of a considerable risk for many individuals in the concerned social segment, of having non-communicable diseases, if observed dietary patterns are continued
Basic summary: Managerial level employees were mainly selected from the private sector in urban areas, aiming to reveal the realistic impact of changed lifestyles in nutrient intakes. Proximate analysis was done for moisture, digestible carbohydrates, insoluble dietary fibre, soluble dietary fibre, fat, protein, Vitamins and minerals. Selected individuals are interviewed using a structured questionnaire to assess their daily food combinations and their consumed portion sizes. 2.2 Questionnaire formation Major aim in designing the questionnaire was to assess the realistic nutrition intake Managerial level employees working in the private sector.

Abstract: This study analysed the market performance of fresh fish marketing in Lagos state, Nigeria. It critically focused on ascertaining the market structure, determining the profitability of fish marketing and determining the marketing efficiency of fresh fish marketing in the study area. Multistage sampling procedure was used to sample 80 fresh fish marketers from Lagos state. The data collected for the study were analysed using Gini coefficient, budgetary technique and shepherd efficiency model. The study revealed that there was inequality in the income distribution among the fresh fish marketers with Gini coefficient of 0.78, it further shows that fresh fish marketing is profitable with gross margin of #27,101.36 and that fish marketing activities among fish marketers is highly efficient (517.5%). Thus, government should help in the provision of a soft loan to the marketers so as to promote fresh fish marketing being a profitable and efficient business
Basic summary: It critically focused on ascertaining the market structure, determining the profitability of fish marketing and determining the marketing efficiency of fresh fish marketing in the study area. This might be probably because the more the quantity of fresh fish in market, the less the marketing price probably because of the perishable nature of fresh fish. Thus, fish marketing activities among fresh fish marketers is highly efficient. Evidence from Adeleke and Afolabi, (2012) and Edward and Madugu, (2011)have established the profitability and marketing efficiency of fresh fish marketing. This indicates that an average marketer earned ₦27,458.28 as gross margin per year suggesting that fresh fish marketing is a profitable venture in the study area. The gross margin formula is explicitly stated below: The budgetary technique involves the cost and return analysis of fish marketing in the study area.

Word count: 2116
Similarity: 0.66556746
Abstract: Quality of bottom soil forms an important component for any kind of  mangrove reforestation as well as  coastal rehabilitation program. Since textural composition plays an important role in determining the soil quality, a study was undertaken to assess the influence of  variations in  soil texture on distribution and abundance of different mangrove species across five zones of Sundarbans Tiger Reserve, India.This study showed these mangrove soils to exhibit good occurrences of  sand particles. However,the  effects of sands  on textural quality were frequently  masked by moderate occurrence of finer soil  particles which rendered the soils to be largely loamy in texture.Such soil conditions favored establishment of mangrove vegetation.  Species wise also, mangrove vegetation was found to be  more diverse in loam, clay loam, sandy loam and sandy clay loam soil textures respectively while a very few species were observed in clay, sandy clay and silty clay soils
Basic summary: Occurrence of these kinds loamy texture may be helpful to maintain a loose soil condition in mangrove soils encouraging good rooting of mangrove vegetation in such soils. Textural compositions of rhizosphere soils for different mangrove species commonly found in Sundarbans Tiger Reserve have been presented in Tables 2 to 6. In the present study, species wise occurrence of different mangrove vegetation appeared to be influenced by the soil textural groups. In Table-7, an effort has been made to identify the mangrove species which were found to be associated with different textural sub-groups of the soils.

Title: Rho- Kinase Inhibitor Y-27632 Decreases the Thickness of Trabecular Meshwork in Juvenile Rats Mod-el Injected with Sodium Hyaluronate
Word count: 2925
Similarity: 0.7900623
Abstract: Most glaucoma drugs lower the intraocular pressure (IOP) by decreasing the aqueous humor production and increasing the outflow through uveoscleral pathway. None of these drugs work mainly on increasing outflow through the trabecular pathway. Consequently, the experiment to develop glaucoma drugs directly target at the trabecular outflow pathway is highly required. The purpose of this study is to reveal the effect of rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 on the thickness of trabecular meshwork in juvenile rats model injected with sodium hyalu-ronate.  This study was an experimental study with posttest only control group design. Twenty-four rats were included in this study. Each eye of the rat would be considered as one sample. Samples were divided into 6 groups, negative control group, positive control I group with intracameral sodium hyaluronate injection, posi-tive control II group with topical Y-27632 10 mM, and three experimental groups with intracameral injection of sodium hyaluronate and Y-27632 10-1 mM, 1 mM, and 10 mM respectively. After the procedures all rats were sacrificed and enucleated. Trabecular meshwork tissue was stained with Hematoxilene-Eosin and evalu-ated under 400× microscopic magnification. Quantitative measurements were taken using computerized image analysis with dot slide program.  There were significant statistic differences among the positive control I group and the experimental groups (p-value &lt; 0.05) as well as the positive control II group and the experi-mental groups (p-value &lt; 0.05). The highest mean of decreasing trabecular meshwork thickness was noted in the group given by sodium hyaluronate and Y-27632 10 mM with value of 118.42 µm. There was decreasing thickness of trabecular meshwork due to the effect of rho- kinase inhibitor Y-27632 in juvenile rats injected with sodium hyaluronate
Basic summary: One-way ANOVA test showed the differences of trabecular meshwork thickness among positive I control group and treatment groups (p < 0.05). The trabecular meshwork thickness was measured after the paraffin process of the tissue and HE staining Y-27632 Decreases Trabecular Meshwork Thickness JTLS | J. Trop. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of rho-kinase inhibitor (Y-27632) on trabecular meshwork thickness in juvenile rat model with sodium hyaluronate injection. One-way ANOVA test showed the differences of trabec- ular meshwork thickness among positive control II group and treatment groups (p < 0.05). The purpose of this study is to reveal the effect of rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 on the thickness of trabecular meshwork in juvenile rats model injected with sodium hyaluronate. There was decreasing thickness of trabecular meshwork due to the effect of rho- kinase inhibitor Y-27632 in juvenile rats injected with sodium hyaluronate. Trabecular meshwork consists of three zones, the uveal meshwork, corneoscle- ral meshwork, and juxtacanalicular connective tissue. The highest mean of decreasing trabecular meshwork thickness was noted in the group given by sodium hyaluronate and Y-27632 10 mM with value of 118.42 µm. Kim JW (2017) Comparative study of the effects of trabecu- lar meshwork outflow drugs on the permeability and nitric oxide production in trabecular meshwork cells. There were two positive control groups and one negative control group used in this study. Trabecular meshwork tissue is recognized to have the highest responsibility in regulating aqueous humor outflow as conventional pathway. The lowest average thickness of the trabecular meshwork was noted in the group receiving Y-27632 10 mM. It is expected that this study is able to be a basic research for further evaluation of molecular changes in the trabecular meshwork due to Y-27632. The main effect of this process would be the reducing of trabecular meshwork contractility that lead to the improvement of aqueous humor outflow [8, 10, 11].

Similarity: 0.80062443
Abstract: Breastfeeding brings great benefits to the child and the mother, however it is known that the practice requires encouragement and proper guidance. Even knowing the nutritional and immunological benefits of breastmilk, many mothers interrupt lactation and add artificial formulas in infant feeding, most often due to myths or difficulties in breastfeeding management. The aim of this study was to identify factors that influence early weaning in Ibi&aacute;, Minas Gerais, Brazil. It was an exploratory, transversal and quantitative research, conducted through questionnaires administered to mothers of children of 0-6 months. As for the most common problems related to breastfeeding experienced by respondents, the main reported was the presence of "milk weak "or&ldquo;little milk&rdquo; with 53.84%. When asked if their children were using pacifiers, 69.73% of respondents reported so. The family and professional support is of utmost importance to the practice of breastfeeding. Nursing should advise on lactation management as well as on the numerous benefits of breast feeding. The nursing team has na important role in this regard, promoting breastfeeding, with preventive actions that contribute to this important stage of the childrens life, thus, breast feeding can belived fully and satisfactorily
Basic summary: The nutritional benefits and protectors of breastfeeding are widely known and accepted, however, the management of breastfeeding is hard work, requiring broad support for breastfeeding (Santos; França-Botelho, 2010). Table 2 refers to questions about the initiation of breastfeeding, pacifier use, diseases that contraindicate breastfeeding and family influence on breast feeding. As for the most common problems related to breastfeeding experienced by respondents, the main reported was the presence of "milk weak "or“little milk” with 53.84%. Table.2: Distribution of respondents as the initiation of breastfeeding, use of pacifiers, diseases that contraindicate breastfeeding and family influence. Keywords — Breast milk, breast feeding, early weaning, breast feeding myths. These factors seem to exert greater influence on breastfeeding than the benefits and advantages of breast milk over formula and artificial milks (Barreira; Machado, 2004). Exclusive breastfeeding, defined as the offer only milk, not even water or tea, allowing only vitamin drops or medications are recommended until the sixth month of life of children. The main reasons cited by volunteers for abandoning exclusive breast feeding were "weak milk" and "low milk." Many mothers interrupt lactation and add artificial formulas in infant feeding, most often due to myths or difficulties in breastfeeding management.

Word count: 2732
Similarity: 0.9194046
Abstract: Assessment of genetic diversity in any crop species provides a basis for devising future strategies for crop improvement; conservation and sustainable use. An experiment consisting of 24 genotypes of Tomato was conducted during the year 2016 at the Research Farm and Molecular Biology Laboratory of School of Biotechnology, SKUAST-J, Chatha. The experiment was conducted in Randomised Block Design (RBD) with three replications in 2 rows of 5m length with spacing of 45 x 90 cm. The extent of genetic divergence /relatedness was estimated among 24 genotypes by using 11 traits viz. plant height (cm), number of branches, number of fruits per bunch, total soluble solids, flesh thickness (mm), number of locules, fruit width (cm), fruit length (cm), yield per plant (g), average fruit weight (g), number of fruits per plant. The maximum number of fruits/bunch was recorded in “Utkal Pragyan” (3.66) and the minimum number was recorded in “Swarna Sampada” (2.03). Maximum TSS(%) was recorded in DCT-1 (8.06%) and minimum TSS was recorded in “Dhanshri” (2.83%). Maximum number of fruits and yield/plant was recorded in “DCT-1” (115.33) and “Hisar Lalit” (2507.36g), respectively. The minimum number of fruits and yield/ plant was recorded in “NDT-4” (23.20) and “DCT-1” (861.40g), respectively.Mean data revealed high range for most of studied traits. Hierarchical cluster analysis allowed the assessment of similarity and clarified some of the relationships among tomato genotypes. UPGMA produced a dendrogram with two main clusters with further sub clusters. Of all the studied 24 genotypes Anand tomato and Hisar lalit were found to be most dissimilar based on UPGMA clustering. Hisar lalit was found to be most promising variety among all the genotypes for most of the traits under study, which can be used for further breeding and crop improvement programmes
Basic summary: of locules Fruit length (cm) Fruit width (cm) Average fruit weight (g) No. High genetic advance was observed for yield per plant, number of fruits per plant, average fruit weight and plant height. Hisar Lalit showed large fruit size with reference to Single fruit weight, Flesh thickness, Fruit length and Fruit width and Yield per plant. High GCV was observed in number of fruits per plant (45.35) and is followed by average fruit weight (32.71) and flesh thickness (29.06). In present study highest estimates of GCV and PCV were recorded for number of fruits per plant (45.35 and 46.57 per cent respectively) which is an important yield component. (2007) who observed high heritability for average fruits weight, fruit length, number of locules/fruit and fruit yield. High heritability (94.80%) with low genetic advance (47.73%) was reported for number of fruits per plant (Table 5). The results showed that there was significant genetic distance between the genotypes for some of the characters like yield and its attributing traits. The minimum number of fruits and yield/ plant was recorded in “NDT-4” (23.20) and “DCT- 1” (861.40g), respectively.Mean data revealed high range for most of studied traits. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 24 genotypes of tomato was evaluated for morphological characters as per the standard procedure. Observations were recorded for the various morphological, agronomical, yield and quality traits in order to study the magnitude of variability and level of genetic divergence in the material. Considerable genetic diversity among the cultivated 24 tomato genotypes was observed at morphological levels, which is of importance for germplasm classification, management, and further utilization. (2015) who showed that high PCV and GCV was observed for plant height followed by average fruit weight estimated.

Word count: 3247
Similarity: 0.9540644
Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in males, the second in females and is the second leading cause of cancer related death worldwide. Despite recent advances in chemotherapy, and targeted therapy for CRC, the prognosis for patients with advanced cancer has remained poor, due to drug resistance, metastasis and recurrence.  A small fraction of cells possess tumor propagation abilities. These are termed “cancer stem cells (CSCs). A subset of colorectal cancer stem cells, may hold a key to controlling cancer. The cancer stem cell (CSC) model suggests that tumors are hierarchically organized, only CSCs possess cancer-promoting potential. The killing of CSCs is thought to be a critical component of effective antitumor therapies.  A number of signaling pathways, most notably the Wingless related (Wnt), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), Notch and Hedgehog signaling and other mechanisms have been found to be associated with CSCs in CRC. They play important roles in maintaining the growth and functional integrity of CSC. Many new molecules are now being studied to block theses pathways. Some of the molecules block the self-renewal and induction of apoptosis in CSCs. The design of CSC-targeted interventions is a rational target, and reduce local recurrence and metastasis. This review aims to summarize the issue on CSCs and signaling pathway relevant for CRC, which may lead to more effective therapeutic strategies for CRC

Title: An analysis of rainfall based on entropy theory
Word count: 3365
Similarity: 0.89398086
Abstract: The principle of maximum entropy can provide consistent basis for analyzing rainfall and for geophysical processes in general. The daily rainfall data was assessed using the Shannon entropy for a 10-years period from 189 stations in the northeastern region of Brazil. Mean values of marginal entropy were computed for all observation stations and isoentropy maps were then constructed for delineating annual and seasonal characteristics of rainfall. The Mann-Kendall test was used to evaluate the long-term trend in marginal entropy for two sample stations. The marginal entropy values of rainfall were higher for locations and periods with highest amount of rainfall. The results also showed that the marginal entropy decreased exponentially with increasing coefficient of variation. The Shannon theory produced spatial patterns which led to a better understanding of rainfall characteristics throughout the northeastern region of Brazil. Trend analysis indicated that most time series did not have any significant trends
Basic summary: Despite large variations of marginal entropy for rainfall between periods and even between stations, the overall analysis showed much less variation of entropy during the dry season. 3, the isoentropy lines of rainfall divided the whole study region into two clusters, at left with higher values in entropy and at right with lower values of entropy. On the other hand, during the dry season entropy values of rainfall reached minimum values as compared to the other two periods as a consequence of the rainfall reduction. (2007) suggested that the variability of rainfall can be more appropriately measured by the Shannon entropy and hence rainfall characteristics of 1- day resolution time series can be described. Our results also showed that there was no an indefinite exponential increase of marginal entropy for rainfall since such increase occurred until it reaches the maximum entropy. However, the variability of rainfall time series can be quantitatively measured by using entropy which can be described in spatial and temporal terms (Mishra et al. For both stations, marginal entropy values of rainfall were low during the dry season and high during the rainy season. The marginal entropy values of rainfall were higher for locations and periods with highest amount of rainfall.

Similarity: 0.7260844
Abstract: Three alternative carbon sources (molasses, cassava glucose syrup and sorghum fructose syrup) on the production of D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) from Trigonopsis variabilis (TvDAAO) has been studied.The aim of this study was to screen out the best alternative carbon sources that can be utilized in TvDAAO production, and to study the effect of the additional nitrogen sources. Screening of carbon sources were carried out using glucose, molasses, cassava glucose syrup (CGS) and sorghum fructose syrup (SFS), at the same glucose levels. Analysis of TvDAAO was measured by o-phenylenediamine/horseradish peroxidase coupling assay. The best alternative carbon source was selected for optimization at various concentrations. The enzyme characteristic was done by determining the stability of enzyme to temperature and pH, and the enzyme kinetic parameter was also observed. The screening showed that cassava sugar syrup is the best alternative carbon source. The optimum concentration of cassava glucose syrup is at 10% of glucose levels, which will produce TvDAAO with the activity equal to 166.8861 U/g yeast cell dry weight. The enzyme characteristics stable at 4-10°C and pH 8, with Vmax value was 0.007 μmol/minute and KM was 78 mM. The used of cassava glucose syrup does not require any additional nitrogen source and it is became the advantageous of CGS as an alternative carbon source in terms of efficiency and economical of TvDAAO production
Basic summary: Optimization of cassava glucose syrup concentration The productivity of cassava glucose syrup can still be improved by increasing the concentration of cassava glucose syrup (Figure 2). Screening of carbon sources were carried out using glucose, molasses, cassava glucose syrup (CGS) and sorghum fructose syrup (SFS), at the same glucose levels. Cassava glucose syrup contains glucose as the main sugar , which is glucose was the best carbon source for TvDAAO production. The concentration of cassava glucose syrup is measured as the glucose content contained in the cassava glucose syrup. The best alternative carbon source is cassava glucose syrup, with enzyme activity obtained is 73.5079 U/g. Figure 2 shows that the highest enzyme activity (166.8861 U/g yeast cell dry weight) was obtained at 10% of glucose levels in cassava glucose syrup. The test tubes were sampled one by one after fixed time intervals, rapidly cooled for 1-2 min in ice, and the enzyme activity was measured as described above. Screening an alternative carbon source and the effect of the additional nitrogen source The screening of an alternative carbon sources were done with a one-at-a-time strategy. The use of cassava glucose syrup as a carbon source can be done without the addition of additional nitrogen sources.

Abstract: A $k$-partite $r$-digraph(multipartite multidigraph) (or briefly MMD)($k\geq 3$, $r\geq 1$) is the result of assigning a direction to each edge of a $k$-partite multigraph that is without loops and contains at most $r$ edges between any pair of vertices from distinct parts. Let $D(X_{1}, X_{2},\cdots, X_{k})$ be a $k$-partite $r$-digraph with parts $X_{i}=\{x_{i1}, x_{i2},\cdots, x_{in_{i}}\}$, $1\leq i\leq k$. Let $d_{x_{ij}}^{+}$ and $d_{x_{ij}}^{-}$ be respectively the outdegree and indegree of a vertex $x_{ij}$ in $X_{i}$. Define $a_{x_{ij}}$ (or simply $a_{ij}$) as $a_{ij}=d_{x_{ij}}^{+}-d_{x_{ij}}^{-}$ as the imbalance of the vertex $x_{ij}$, $1\leq j\leq n_{i}$. In this paper, we characterize the imbalances of $k$-partite $r$-digraphs and give a constructive and existence criteria for sequences of integers to be the imbalances of some $k$-partite $r$-digraph. Also, we show the existence of a $k$-partite $r$-digraph with the given imbalance set
Basic summary: The case when k = 1 gives multidigraph and when k = 2 gives bipartite multidigraph, and these have been studied in . Note that we have 1 ≤ i ≤ k and 1 ≤ j ≤ ni, unless otherwise stated. Define axij (or simply aij) as aij = d + xij − d−xij as the imbalance of the vertex xij , 1 ≤ j ≤ ni. J. Define axij (or simply aij)= d + xij − d−xij as the imbalance of the vertiex xij , where 1 ≤ j ≤ ni.

To prepare such a product it has to be proven that tetrofosmin can be labeled with high activity of Tc-99m and the resulted Tc-99m tetrofosmin, remains stable within shipping time until being used in hospitals. In this investigation, locally produced tetrofosmin kits were labeled with various radioactivity of Tc-99m ranging from 150 mCi to 400 mCi, their radiolabeling yields or radiochemical purity was analyzed using SepPak C18 column, and the radiochemical stability was assessed within 30 hours. The worst storage condition was also studied by analyzing its radiochemical purity after being stored at extreme temperatures for several hours. The results showed that tetrofosmin kit can be highly labeled with up to 415 mCi of Tc-99m, and stable up to 30 hours in room temperature, and there is a tendency that higher radioactivity leads to more decreasing in radiochemical purity. Stability study in extreme temperatures showed that the product can withstand its stability within 6 hours in 40°C, but it decreased rapidly to less than 70% within 1 hour when stored in 50°C. It concludes that the quality of Tc-99m tetrofosmin as an injectable radiopharmaceutical can be maintained during transportation by storing it at cool temperature
Basic summary: Radiochemical stability of Tc-99m tetrofosmin was assessed by measuring the radiochemical purity after storing the labeled compound at room temperature for several hours. Therefore, in radiolabeling of tetrofosmin kit, although using much higher radioactivity of Tc-99m the mole of tetrofosmin can still be assumed excessive. Trend of radiochemical stability of Tc-99m tetrofosmin of various radioactivity during storage at room temperature The results as mentioned above conformed with a publication reported by Jia et. Usually, tetrofosmin kits and Tc-99m pertechnetate are supplied separately, but recently there has been a new trend where Tc-99m tetrofosmin is supplied in the form of the ready-to-inject product. The quality of labeled compound which was represented as the radiochemical purity of Tc-99m tetrofosmin was analyzed by separation method using SepPak C18 column. Stability of Tc-99m tetrofosmin (150 mCi) upon storage at various temperature was observed within 6 hours, and the result of stability test is shown in (Figure 2). The radiochemical purity of Tc-99m tetrofosmin which was prepared with various radioactivity of Tc-99m is shown in Table 1. The percentage of radioactivity in the second fraction represented the radiolabeling yield or radiochemical purity of Tc-99m tetrofosmin.

Title: Internal variation temperature analysis and thermal mapping of a central processing unit (CPU)
Word count: 2614
Similarity: 0.95321894
Abstract: This work aims to analyze the internal temperature variation of the central processing unit (CPU) of a personal computer, through the development of three distinct scenarios: one for reference and two aiming at its performance improvement. The finite volume method (FVM) was applied. Thus, Hypermesh 13.0 software was used for geometric model development and for surface mesh generation. For model contour conditions configuration, virtual simulation and post-processing, Starccm+ software was used. The results of this work indicated hot spots due to the heat dissipated during the operation of the CPU components. As expected, the processor region presented the highest temperatures in all proposed scenarios. The opening on the side of the cabinet, proposed in scenario 2, allowed a temperature reduction of about 18 °C in the processor region. In turn, scenario 3, in which heat exchangers were used in order to minimize the temperature of the hot air from the recirculation in the processor region, showed a minimum temperature reduction (about 3 °C) when compared to scenario 1
Basic summary: 9a shows that the hot spot relative to the heat flux generated by the heat dissipation of the processor continues at a temperature above 60 °C. The authors observed that the cooling air flow rate and the incoming energy influence the overall flat fin heat pipe heat resistance. 5b shows the temperature variation for the Z- direction cut with height equal to 140 mm, where can be noted a concentrated flow of hot air exiting the processor. The opening in the region opposite to the processor allowed the discharge of the hot air that was previously trapped inside the CPU, allowing a temperature drop. The proposed gap allowed the hot air flow dissipated by the processor to be released to the external environment, avoiding much of the recirculation observed in the reference scenario. The inclusion of heat exchangers in the processor region reduces the operating temperature of the CPU in about 3 °C. The opening on the side of the cabinet, proposed in scenario 2, allowed a temperature reduction of about 18 °C in the processor region. The region that presented the highest temperatures was the processor area, as it dissipated a larger amount of heat under operating conditions, as indicated by .

Abstract: Background: In diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperglycemia may increase malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Isolates 1,4-bis-(3,4,5-trimethoxy-phenyl)-tetrahydro-furo (3,4-c) furan from mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla king) can lower blood glucose levels of diabetic rats. This study aimed to examine the blood MDA level of diabetic rats treated with the isolated seeds of mahogany.Subjects and Method: This was an experimental study conducted at the Laboratory of Center for Food and Nutrition Studies, Inter-University Center, Gadjah Mada University, Yogyakarta. A sample of 36 male Wistar rats, 8-10 weeks old, body weight 200-250 grams, was divided randomly into 6 groups, namely: KN (normal control), K (-) (DM without therapy), K (+) (DM + glibenclamide 0.45 mg/kg BW), P1, P2, and P3 (DM + isolate of 10 mg/kgBW, 20 mg/kg BW, and 40mg/kg BW). Therapy was given for 21 consecutive days. Streptozotocin 45 mg/kgBW and nicotinamide 110 mg/kgBW were used to induce the occurrence of diabetic rats. Examination of blood MDA level was performed at H- (before mouse modelled DM), H0 (when mice were modelled DM but not yet treated), H7 (after 7 days of therapy), H14 (after 14 days of therapy), and H21 (after 21 days of therapy). MDA levels (nmol/mL) were measured by thiobarbituric acid reacting substances (TBARS) method. Data were analyzed by One Way ANOVA test followed by Tukey HSD and repeated ANOVA test followed by LSD.Results: When H-, mean MDA levels of all groups within normal limits (<2 nmol/ mL), ie: KN 1.25 ± 0.16 nmol/ mL, K (-) 1.22 ± 0.14 nmol/ mL, K (+) 1.44 ± 0.23 nmol/ mL, P1 1.40 ± 0.14 nmol/ mL, P2 1.54 ± 0.07 nmol/ mL, P3 1.47 ± 0.17 nmol/ mL. When H0, mean MDA content at K (-) 8.83 ± 0.12 nmol/ mL, K (+) 8.94 ± 0.28 nmol/ mL, P1 9.01 ± 0.22 nmol/ mL, P2 9.00 ± 0.32 nmol/ mL, and P3 9.23 ± 0.42 nmol/ mL which means higher than normal, while the KN is still within normal limits, ie 1.42 ± 0.21 nmol/ mL. Within 21 days of treatment, mean MDA levels in each treatment group (K (+), P1, P2, and P3) showed significant decreases over time (H0 to H21). Differences in MDA levels between H0 and H7, H7 and H14, H14 and H21 showed p< 0.001. After 21 days of treatment (at H21) there was a significant difference between MDA and p< 0.001, except between pair-wise KN and K (+) with p= 0.724, KN and P3 with p= 0.865, and K (+) and P3 with p= 1.000 which means the difference is not meaningful.Conclusion: Furan Seed isolation therapy is effective for reducing MDA levels. MDA levels of diabetic mice receiving 1.4-bis- (3,4,5-trimethoxy-phenyl) isolate therapy -tetrahydro-furo (3,4-c) furan from mahogany seeds (Swietenia macrophylla King) 40 mg/ kgBW decreased significantly until levels reached a normal state equivalent to mice receiving glibenclamide therapy.Keywords: malondialdehyde, mahogany seed, isolate, diabete

The subject of this research was the eight grade students of SMP N.2 Sipahutar in academic year 2017/2018, while the object of research was the result of learning and students\u27 activity while learning with the application of Bruner\u27s theory on the subject of parallel line. This research was a descriptive research, and the instrument of data collection used was the test in the form of description and students\u27 activity observation sheet. Based on the result of data analysis, the results of the research are: (1) The average score of learning result obtained by students is 24.64 with the average grade 77.02 or with the percentage of mastery level of 77.02%. It shows that the students\u27 level of mastery is still classified as moderate. (2) Student\u27s learning completeness: a) Persuasion ability, many students who completed the study were 27 students, while the unfinished study was 4 students, b) Classical absorption, from 31 students there are 27 students or 93.55% completed the study, while the unfinished study is 4 students from 31 students or 6.45%. It shows that classically, the students\u27 learning completeness is achieved; (3) Achievement of specific learning objectives was over 65.0%. (4) Students\u27 activity, activity level on first learning is equal to 75,71 and the mean of students\u27 activity reliability level is equal to 82,62%; students\u27 activity level on the second learning is equal to 88,82 and the mean of students\u27 activity reliability level is equal to 84,61%, it concluded that there is increase of students\u27 activity during learning
Basic summary: Student learning completeness a) Individual absorption The total number of students who completed the study is 27 students, while the unfinished study is 4 students. Absorption of individual students obtained from 31 students, 29 students or 93.55% of the total subjects have completed learning, means have been completed and classically achieved. To see the students’ intellectual involved in learning geometry, the teachers need to track students' intellectual development. It shows that classically, the students' learning completeness is achieved; (3) Achievement of specific learning objectives was over 65.0%. According to Bruner in Bell (1978) the notion of a concept in the early stages of students learning the concept, is dependent on activities that use concrete objects. The use of notation that is not in accordance with the level of intellectual development of students obviously will disrupt the students understanding. The average score of learning outcomes obtained by students is 24.64 with the average grade is 77.02 or with the percentage of mastery level of 77.02%. Therefore, the teacher is also required to be able to apply the theory of learning in the process of teaching and learning.

Abstract: The writer, Robert Lee Frost, was a nature poet, a poet who spoke with rhyme and meter of all things natural, and in so doing plumbed the depths of emotion of people in all walks of life. In describing a simple act of nature, the mundane, or the heartfelt grief of people, Robert Frost elucidates an insight into the sometimes-simple instances in our lives that when brought together constitute our very lives. Some of Frost\u27s most beautiful work displays this unadorned reality of life. In all of Frost\u27s works, the reader sees captured in verse a depth and level of human emotion that is not easily discerned by the eye, but rather felt and nurtured in the heart, Robert Frost uses nature at its most beautiful to explain life at its harshest
Basic summary: In the final four lines of the poem, the old man knows that if the woodchuck were still around it could define the nature of the sleep. In the smell of the apple blossoms and the beauty of the russet color of the apple, the reader realizes the old man’s love of his apple orchard. Knowing that men and women deal with every emotion differently, it would seem that dealing with grief differently would not come as a surprise, but it does. By using the senses of smell, tough, and even sight, Frost lets nature ease the old man into rest.

Title: How Much do Predisposing, Enabling, and Reinforcing Factors Influence the Use of Immunization in Infants? A Path Analysis Evidence from Bangkalan Regency, Madura
Word count: 371
Similarity: 0.89105123
Abstract: Background: Child immunization averts an estimated 2 to 3 million deaths every year from diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), and measles. However, an additional 1.5 million deaths could be avoided if global vaccination coverage improves. In Indonesia, complete basic immunization (CBI) had been implemented as a disease prevention effort among children. However, the CBI did not yet achieve national target. Bangkalan Regency, Madura, was one of the regencies in East Java with low immunization achievement. This study aimed to estimate the association between predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors, and the use of basic immunization, using PRECEDE-PROCEED model.Subjects and Method: This was a cross sectional study conducted at 10 community health centers, Bangkalan Regency, from August to October 2017. A total sample of 200 infants aged 9-12 months along with their mothers were selected for this study using cluster random sampling and fixed disease sampling. The dependent variable was the use of basic immunization service. The independent variables were education, knowledge, occupation, attitude, distance to healthcare facilities, information exposure, family support, and health workers support. The data were colected using questionnaires and MCH book. The data were analyzed by path analysis.Result: The use of basic immunization service increased by positive maternal attitude (b= 0.82; 95% CI= 0.10 to 1.55; p= 0.027), health personnel support (b= 0.79; 95% CI= -0.10 to 1.67; p= 0.081), information exposure (b= 1.52; 95% CI= 0.75 to 2.29; p= 0.001), but decreased with distance to healthcare facilities (b= -1.28; 95% CI= -2.13 to -0.44; p= 0.003). The use of basic immunization service was indirectly influenced by family support, knowledge, maternal employment, and maternal education.Conclusion: The use of basic immunization service increases by positive maternal attitude, health personnel support, information exposure, but decreases with distance to healthcare facilities.

Abstract: Background: In diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperglycemia may increase malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Isolates 1,4-bis-(3,4,5-trimethoxy-phenyl)-tetrahydro-furo (3,4-c) furan from mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla king) can lower blood glucose levels of diabetic rats. This study aimed to examine the blood MDA level of diabetic rats treated with the isolated seeds of mahogany.Subjects and Method: This was an experimental study conducted at the Laboratory of Center for Food and Nutrition Studies, Inter-University Center, Gadjah Mada University, Yogyakarta. A sample of 36 male Wistar rats, 8-10 weeks old, body weight 200-250 grams, was divided randomly into 6 groups, namely: KN (normal control), K (-) (DM without therapy), K (+) (DM + glibenclamide 0.45 mg/kg BW), P1, P2, and P3 (DM + isolate of 10 mg/kgBW, 20 mg/kg BW, and 40mg/kg BW). Therapy was given for 21 consecutive days. Streptozotocin 45 mg/kgBW and nicotinamide 110 mg/kgBW were used to induce the occurrence of diabetic rats. Examination of blood MDA level was performed at H- (before mouse modelled DM), H0 (when mice were modelled DM but not yet treated), H7 (after 7 days of therapy), H14 (after 14 days of therapy), and H21 (after 21 days of therapy). MDA levels (nmol/mL) were measured by thiobarbituric acid reacting substances (TBARS) method. Data were analyzed by One Way ANOVA test followed by Tukey HSD and repeated ANOVA test followed by LSD.Results: When H-, mean MDA levels of all groups within normal limits (<2 nmol/ mL), ie: KN 1.25 ± 0.16 nmol/ mL, K (-) 1.22 ± 0.14 nmol/ mL, K (+) 1.44 ± 0.23 nmol/ mL, P1 1.40 ± 0.14 nmol/ mL, P2 1.54 ± 0.07 nmol/ mL, P3 1.47 ± 0.17 nmol/ mL. When H0, mean MDA content at K (-) 8.83 ± 0.12 nmol/ mL, K (+) 8.94 ± 0.28 nmol/ mL, P1 9.01 ± 0.22 nmol/ mL, P2 9.00 ± 0.32 nmol/ mL, and P3 9.23 ± 0.42 nmol/ mL which means higher than normal, while the KN is still within normal limits, ie 1.42 ± 0.21 nmol/ mL. Within 21 days of treatment, mean MDA levels in each treatment group (K (+), P1, P2, and P3) showed significant decreases over time (H0 to H21). Differences in MDA levels between H0 and H7, H7 and H14, H14 and H21 showed p< 0.001. After 21 days of treatment (at H21) there was a significant difference between MDA and p< 0.001, except between pair-wise KN and K (+) with p= 0.724, KN and P3 with p= 0.865, and K (+) and P3 with p= 1.000 which means the difference is not meaningful.Conclusion: Furan Seed isolation therapy is effective for reducing MDA levels. MDA levels of diabetic mice receiving 1.4-bis- (3,4,5-trimethoxy-phenyl) isolate therapy -tetrahydro-furo (3,4-c) furan from mahogany seeds (Swietenia macrophylla King) 40 mg/ kgBW decreased significantly until levels reached a normal state equivalent to mice receiving glibenclamide therapy.Keywords: malondialdehyde, mahogany seed, isolate, diabete

Word count: 245
Similarity: 0.95062876
Abstract: Background: Ureter obstruction can cause permanent renal damage. In theory, the Indonesian propolis extract (IPE) may play an important role as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. This study aimed to determine the nephroprotective effect of IPE in reducing interstitial fibrosis, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and increasing body weight in mice with unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO).Subjects and Method: This study was a quasi experiment. A total sample of 32 mice was allocated into four groups: (1) Mice without UUO; (2) Mice with UUO; (3) Mice with UUO privided with IPE (orally 50mg/ kgBW); (4) Mice with UUO provided with IPE (orally 100mg/ kgBW). After 30 days of intervention, the mice were killed for interstitial fibrosis analysis. Mean differences in body weight, sistolic blood pressure (SBP), and interstitial fibrosis were tested by one way ANNOVA and Kruskal Wallis.Results: Interstitial fibrosis and SBP were higher in group 2 than group 1 resulting from UUO (p< 0.05). Body weight was lower in group 2 than group 1 resulting from UUO (p< 0.05). Interstitial fibrosis and SBP were lower in both group 3 and 4 than group 2 (p< 0.05), indicating that IPE was effective in reducing interstitial fibrosis and SBP. Body weight was higher in group 3 and 4 than group 2 (p< 0.05), indicating that IPE was effective in increasing body weight.Conclusion: IPE can effectively reduce interstitial fibrosis and SBP in mice, and increase body weight.Keywords: renal ureter obstructive damage, Indonesian propolis extrac

Title: How Much do Predisposing, Enabling, and Reinforcing Factors Influence the Use of Immunization in Infants? A Path Analysis Evidence from Bangkalan Regency, Madura
Word count: 371
Similarity: 0.89105123
Abstract: Background: Child immunization averts an estimated 2 to 3 million deaths every year from diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), and measles. However, an additional 1.5 million deaths could be avoided if global vaccination coverage improves. In Indonesia, complete basic immunization (CBI) had been implemented as a disease prevention effort among children. However, the CBI did not yet achieve national target. Bangkalan Regency, Madura, was one of the regencies in East Java with low immunization achievement. This study aimed to estimate the association between predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors, and the use of basic immunization, using PRECEDE-PROCEED model.Subjects and Method: This was a cross sectional study conducted at 10 community health centers, Bangkalan Regency, from August to October 2017. A total sample of 200 infants aged 9-12 months along with their mothers were selected for this study using cluster random sampling and fixed disease sampling. The dependent variable was the use of basic immunization service. The independent variables were education, knowledge, occupation, attitude, distance to healthcare facilities, information exposure, family support, and health workers support. The data were colected using questionnaires and MCH book. The data were analyzed by path analysis.Result: The use of basic immunization service increased by positive maternal attitude (b= 0.82; 95% CI= 0.10 to 1.55; p= 0.027), health personnel support (b= 0.79; 95% CI= -0.10 to 1.67; p= 0.081), information exposure (b= 1.52; 95% CI= 0.75 to 2.29; p= 0.001), but decreased with distance to healthcare facilities (b= -1.28; 95% CI= -2.13 to -0.44; p= 0.003). The use of basic immunization service was indirectly influenced by family support, knowledge, maternal employment, and maternal education.Conclusion: The use of basic immunization service increases by positive maternal attitude, health personnel support, information exposure, but decreases with distance to healthcare facilities. The use of basic immunization service is indirectly influenced by family support, knowledge, maternal employment, and maternal education.Keywords: basic immunization, predisposing, enabling, reinforcing, PRECEDE-PROCEE

Abstract: Background: Obesity is a public health problem that has raised concern worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, there will be about 2.3 billion overweight people aged 15 years and above, and over 700 million obese people worldwide in 2015. Being overweight or obese in childhood can contributes to numerous health conditions in adulthood including: hypertension, high LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol or high levels of triglycerides, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and stroke. This study aimed to analyze the life course factors affecting overweight and obesity in children aged 2 to 5 years old in Surakarta, Central Java.Subjects and Method: This was a case control study was conducted in 5 community health centers, Surakarta, Central Java, from September to October 2017. A sample of 150 children aged 2 to 5 years old was selected for this study by fixed disease sampling. The dependent variable was overweight or obesity. The independent variables were nutrition intake, exclusive breastfeeding, starting age of complementary feeding, physical activity, birthweight, age of gestation, sectio cesarea labor, maternal body mass index, and maternal job. Physical activity data was measured using Pre PAQ questionnaire. Other data were collected using a set of questionnaire and maternal and child health monitoring book. The data were analyzed by path analysis.Results: Overweight and obesity in children aged 2 to 5 years old were positively affected by over nutrition intake (b= 1.9; 95% CI= 0.15 to 3.60; p= 0.033), high maternal body mass index (b= 2.0; 95% CI= 0.51 to 3.42; p= 0.008), and sectio cesarean birth (b= 2.1; 95% CI= 0.56 to 3.73; p= 0.008). Overweight and obesity in children aged 2 to 5 years old were negatively affected by normal birthweight (b= -2.2; 95% CI= -4.28 to -0.19; p= 0.032), exclusive breastfeeding (b= -2.0; 95% CI= -3.60 to -0.39; p=0.015), timely starting age of complementary feeding (b= -1.3; 95% CI= -2.80 to 0.11; p=0.072), and high physical activity (b= -3.0; 95% CI= -4.63 to -1.37; p= 0.001). Overweight and obesity in children aged 2 to 5 years old were indirectly affected by age of gestation and working outside the house.Conclusion: Overweight and obesity in children aged 2 to 5 years old are positively affected by over nutrition intake, high maternal body mass index, and sectio cesarean birth. Overweight and obesity in children aged 2 to 5 years old are negatively affected by normal birthweight, exclusive breastfeeding, timely starting age of complementary feeding, and high physical activity.Keywords: life course factors, overweight, obesity, path analysis

Similarity: 0.9075929
Abstract: Purpose: to demonstrate 1H-MR spectroscopy of the frontal region in patients with metabolic syndrome and to correlate the metabolic ratios with anthropometric measurement. Material and methods: A prospective study was conducted upon 20 patients with metabolic syndrome (10 male, 10 female; mean age 52 years) and 20 age- and sex-matched volunteers. Patients were mild-moderate (n = 14) and marked and morbid obesity (n = 6). Patients and volunteers underwent 1H-MR spectroscopy of the frontal region. The Ch/Cr and NAA/Cr ratio were calculated and correlated with anthropometric measurement. Results: The Cho/Cr and NAA/Cr of patients with Mets (1.03 ± 0.08 and 1.62 ± 0.08) were significantly different (p = 0.001) to those of volunteers (0.78 ± 0 and 1.71 ± 0.61, respectively). The Cho/Cr and NAA/Cr cutoffs used to differentiate patients from volunteers were 0.89 and 1.77 with areas under the curve of 0.992 and 0.867 and accuracy of 97% and 93%, respectively. There was a significant difference in Cho/Cr and NAA/Cr between patients with marked-morbid obesity and moderate-mild obesity (p = 0.001 respectively). Conclusions: We concluded that NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr ratios of the frontal region can differentiate patients with metabolic syndrome from volunteers and are well correlated with the anthropometric measurement
Basic summary: In this study, the mean metabolite ratios of the frontal region in patients with metabolic syndrome were different than that of volunteers.

Title: Cerebral arteriovenous malformations : usability of Spetzler-Martin and Spetzler-Ponce scales in qualification to endovascular embolisation and neurosurgical procedure
Word count: 2922
Similarity: 0.9146625
Abstract: Purpose: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are connected with cerebral haemorrhage, seizures, increased intracranial pressure, headaches, mass effect, and ischaemia symptoms. Selection of the best treatment method or even deciding if intervention is required can be difficult. Material and methods: The study included 50 patients who were diagnosed with cerebral AVMs and treated in our Centre between 2008 and 2014. A total of 111 procedures were performed, including 94 endovascular embolisations and 17 neurosurgical procedures. Medical records and imaging data were reviewed for all patients. All AVMs were measured and assessed, allowing classification in Spetzler-Martin and Spetzler-Ponce scales. Results: Complete or partial treatment was observed in 88.24% of neurosurgical procedures and in 84.00% of embolisations. Early complication rate was 21.28% for embolisation and 17.65% for neurosurgical procedures, while Glasgow Outcome Scale was 4.89 (σ = 0.38) and 5.0 (σ = 0.00), respectively. According to the Spetzler-Martin scale, cerebral haemorrhages occurred more frequently in grade 1, but no statistical significance was observed. In Spetzler- Ponce class B lower grades in Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) were noticed (p = 0.02). Lower GCS scores were also correlated with deep location of AVM and with eloquence of adjacent brain. Patients with Spetzler-Martin grade 1 were more frequently qualified for neurosurgical procedures than other patients. Conclusions: Treating AVMs requires coordination of a multidisciplinary team. Both endovascular embolisation and neurosurgical procedure should be considered as a part of multimodal, frequently multistage treatment. Spetzler-Martin and Spetzler-Ponce scales have an influence on haemorrhage frequency and patients’ clinical condition and should be taken into consideration in selecting the treatment method
Basic summary: Patients who were evaluated as Spetzler-Martin scale grade 1 were more frequently qualified to neurosurgical procedure than patients in higher grades (Figure 2). Endovascular treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations using a liquid embolic agent: results of a prospective, multicentre study (BRAVO). Two invasive methods of AVMs treatment were used in our Centre: neurosurgical procedure and endovascular embolisation. A proposed grading system for endovascular treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations: Buffalo score. If the patients had not been qual- ified to invasive treatment in our Centre, conservative treatment was implemented or the patient was referred to radiosurgery in other centres. Both endovascular embolisation and neurosurgical procedure should be considered as a part of multimodal, frequently multistage treatment. Sixty-five procedures (69.15%) led to complete embolisation of one feeding vessel, fulfilling the aim of the procedure, as a part of multistage treatment. Both endovascular embolisation and neuro- surgical procedure should be considered as part of multi- modal, frequently multistage treatment. Spetzler- Martin and Spetzler-Ponce scales have an influence on haemorrhage frequency and patients’ clinical condition and should be taken into consideration in selecting the treatment method. Arteriovenous malformations characteristics and qualification for treatment Medical records were reviewed for all patients. Invasive treatment of unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations is experimental therapy. Patients with Spetzler-Martin grade 1 were more frequently qualified for neurosurgical procedures than other patients. Treatment methods The amount of endovascular embolisation and neurosur- gical procedures was analysed. A total of 111 procedures were performed, including 17 neurosurgical (mean age: 34.88 years, σ = 11.02) and 94 endovascular (mean age: 38.56 years, σ = 13.86) procedures.

Similarity: 0.9515288
Abstract: Papillary cystadenoma of the epididymis (PCE) is the second most common benign neoplasm of the epididymis [1]. It is very uncommon and has never been reported in a prepubertal male. It may occur sporadically, but more often occurs in association with von Hippel- Lindau (VHL) disease [2]. There have been over 60 reports of patients with such tumors, with the youngest patient being 16 years old. We present the case of a 12- year old male with a history of stage IV neuroblastoma. He presented with a left paratesticular mass that was discovered on routine follow up physical exam with his pediatric oncologist. He was asymptomatic at the time of presentation with no signs or symptoms of hypoandrogenism. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis was negative for lymphadenopathy and additional disease sites. Given the patient's history of stage IV neuroblastoma, there was suspicion of yolk sac tumor or metastases; he underwent an open radical left orchiectomy. Frozen section was consistent with yolk sac tumor, however final pathology revealed normal testicle with PCE. To date, this patient is the youngest reported patient with this diagnosis; furthermore papillary cystadenoma of the epididymis has never been reported in a patient with neuroblastoma
