Title: Making family: the journey into exile of a South Sudan refugee - part 2 #LSEreturn
Word count: 1695
Abstract: Through the story of Chol, LSE’s Naomi Pendle explores the meaning of exile and the lived experience of being a refugee through cycles of displacement and return. In the first article of this two-part series, Pendle tells us how Chol rebuilt home after years spent in exile. Now, LSE’s Naomi Pendle narrates Chol’s return into exile, a journey that was in itself a return and cemented his ability to build a family

basic summary: Now, LSE’s Naomi Pendle narrates Chol’s return into exile, a journey that was in itself a return and cemented his ability to build a family. It was these networks, as much as a journey to a safe space, that he sought to cement as safety for himself, his wife and his son. Yet, they knew that the journey would be fraught with dangers and force them to weave between government and rebel held territories.

sim_matrix summary: Safety for Chol was the return to northern Sudan and the familiar values of business. He feared others would advise against this journey as people had already tried to reach Khartoum and not all had been safe. Yet, they knew that the journey would be fraught with dangers and force them to weave between government and rebel held territories.

Title: Young people are highly critical of Brexit and fear the insularity it could bring
Word count: 1070
Abstract: Most young people did not support Brexit and the referendum result left many feeling frustrated and disempowered, write Shakuntala Banaji and Sam Mejias (LSE). They fear the vote will make the UK more insular and are highly critical of the way the campaign was conducted. In focus groups, they showed a strong understanding of the EU – and want a Brexit settlement that tackles inequality as well as ensuring Britain is an open and welcoming country
basic similarity: 0.32409041521935816
basic summary: A minority of respondents asserted that the referendum and subsequent events had been a ‘participation catalyst’ for young people to become more politically active. As soon as people voted leave, there were attacks on minorities…I don’t know [if] people thought it was more OK to be racist, because they were leaving [the EU]. Secondly, young people expressed dissatisfaction that the oldest generations (65+) should have such a disproportionate influence on the futures of the youngest citizens.

Although these were complex, and not a simple matter of the young ‘blaming’ everyone older than them, we were told of two levels of resentment: in the first case, young people under 18 felt deprived of a voice and overwhelmingly said that if they could, they would have voted to remain.

Taking this trajectory into account, the European Council would ensure that future ‘trade and economic cooperation’ would provide expression to ‘a balance of rights and obligations, preserve a level playing field, avoid upsetting existing relations with other third countries, and…preserve the integrity and proper functioning of the Single Market.’ Government’s hopes for a Canada-styled agreement LSE Brexit: What precisely does ‘Canada +++’ mean?

Title: The political significance of Poland's government reshuffle
Word count: 1984
Abstract: A sweeping reshuffle by Poland's new prime minister has changed the shape and direction of its government, with a greater emphasis being placed on economic modernisation, political stabilisation and improving EU relations. But as Aleks Szczerbiak writes, this pivot to the technocratic centre risks alienating the ruling party's core electorate, and is more about packaging the government's reforms attractively than abandoning its its radical state re-construction programme

Title: What the 2015 Greek debt negotiations tell us about Germany's negotiating stance on Brexit
Word count: 1401
Abstract: If the UK wants to secure favourable terms during the Brexit negotiations, it will be crucial to win the support of Germany. But what are the key German priorities as the talks move on to the second phase? Luuk Molthof writes that the 2015 Greek debt negotiations offer some insights into the German approach, and that the UK is likely to be disappointed if it believes Germany will put economic interests above its political support for European integration

basic summary: To understand why the British government would do well to heed these warnings, it is useful to be reminded of Germany’s role in the 2015 Greek bailout negotiations. The reason why Germany ultimately agreed to another bailout was because a Greek exit from the eurozone would undermine the euro’s credibility as an instrument of political integration. Yet in order to protect the euro’s role as a political instrument, Germany was willing to bear the economic costs.

Title: Quantity does matter as citation impact increases with productivity
Word count: 1040
Abstract: Many scholars are encouraged to focus on the quality not the quantity of their publications, the rationale being that becoming too focused on productivity risks reducing the quality of one's work. But is this, in fact, the case? Peter van den Besselaar and Ulf Sandström have studied a large sample of researchers and found that, while results vary by field, there is a positive and stronger than linear relationship between productivity and quality (in terms of the top cited papers). This same pattern appears to apply to institutions as well as individual researchers
basic similarity: 0.4164438026846855
basic summary: Figure 3: Relationship between number of papers per university and impact in terms of Top10% papers. For each researcher we calculated the (field-normalised and fractionally counted) total number of publications and also the number of those publications that figure in the (2.5%) highest cited papers. In the social sciences, the (slightly) “diminishing returns” pattern seems to dominate; whereas the “impact ceiling” pattern was found for computer science & mathematics and for the humanities. Higher numbers of papers do result in even higher numbers of top cited papers.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.5156065182243281
sim_matrix summary: Figure 1 shows the various possible relationships between “quality” and “quantity” that may exist: (i) there may be an “impact ceiling”, meaning that after a certain number of papers the number of highly cited papers stabilises; there could be (ii) diminishing; (iii) constant; or even (iv) increasing “impact returns” from productivity; and finally (v) “small may be beautiful” in the sense that the number of high-impact papers decreases when authors become too productive, trading quality for quantity. Our understanding, developed in a recent PLoS ONE paper, is that there is a positive and stronger than linear relationship between productivity and quality (in terms of the top cited papers). We tested this using the Leiden Ranking 2014, which details the number of papers and the number of papers belonging to the top 10% highly cited papers for all universities included. This size effect also holds at organisational level, something we did not address in the PLoS ONE paper but tested after a reviewer claimed the opposite: “the CWTS Leiden Ranking, for example, does not show such a linear relationship as the authors claim between the number of papers produced by a university and the percentage of highly cited papers produced by that university”.

Title: Far right politics in Germany: from fascism to populism?
Word count: 1606
Abstract: The rise of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) was one of the major stories of the 2017 German elections. As Tomá\v Nociar and Jan Philipp Thomeczek write, there has been a tendency among some commentators to draw parallels between the AfD and extremist or fascist parties from Germany's past. They argue that this is both unhelpful and inaccurate, and that the AfD has far more in common with other ‘populist’ parties who have had success in recent European elections

basic summary: LSE European Politics and Policy (EUROPP) Blog: Far right politics in Germany: From fascism to populism? This new type of populist radical right party either never developed or dropped the antidemocratic sentiment in favour of a populist critique of the establishment. It is the rise of a populist radical right that is successful precisely because of its populism and not because it embodies fascism or extremism.

Title: LSE festival Beveridge 2.0 preview: 'why we need a citizen's basic income: a new edition or a new book?' by Malcolm Torry
Word count: 1430
Abstract: On Tuesday 20 February 2018, LSE hosted a ‘Citizen’s Basic Income Day’, including the LSE Festival evening event, ‘Beveridge Rebooted: A Basic Income for Every Citizen?’: listen to the podcast here. Ahead of the discussion, panellist Dr Malcolm Torry discusses his forthcoming new book on the topic, Why We Need a Citizen’s Basic Income, and how it builds on his previous works, including Money for Everyone: Why We Need a Citizen’s Income

basic summary: Everyone of the same age would receive the same amount, every week or every month, no matter what their income, wealth, employment status, household structure, etc. We decided to put detailed research results in an online appendix because we believed that the figures would go out of date much faster than the book.

sim_matrix summary: A Citizen’s Basic Income (sometimes called a Basic Income, a Citizen’s Income or a Universal Basic Income) is an unconditional and nonwithdrawable income for every individual. The final two chapters were about alternatives to Citizen’s Basic Income, and about the social problems that a Citizen’s Basic Income would not solve.

Title: Who is helped by Help to Buy?
Word count: 1831
Abstract: What's not to like about a policy which can expand home ownership and boost the supply of housing? Geoff Meeks and J.Gay Meeks recount some of the doubts about the efficacy of the government's Help to Buy scheme. They present new evidence on some of its regressive distributional consequences, and touch on the opportunity cost of the subsidy programme
basic similarity: 0.407356173557794
basic summary: These are “equity loans”, which means the government’s stake in a participating house changes at the same rate with the value of the house. As house prices rise, the argument goes, the government achieves capital gains, which offset the interest costs of servicing the debt which funds H2B. So the new house will be much the better buy, and it will be worth her while to pay more for the new than for the second- hand house.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.42080610435706217
sim_matrix summary: One consequence of the H2B subsidy further stoking the inflation of house prices is that the initial aim of the scheme is subverted: renters who can’t take advantage of the H2B subsidy are left further behind. Table 1 shows the total H2B loans extended by the government nationally in each year since 2013; and the builders’ average profit margin and return on equity for two years before and each year after H2B began. As it is only available for new homes, a Londoner faced with the choice between a new house costing £550k and an identical second-hand house at the same price can get an H2B subsidy of around £7k a year (the interest saved) if she opts for the new house.
text_rank similarity: 0.39348369546530537
text_rank summary: But similarly, if house prices fall, then the Exchequer will be faced not just with the interest bill but also with a capital loss impairing the public sector balance sheet: the total cost of H2B will be higher still.One report suggests that H2B has allowed builders to raise selling prices by towards 10%.So on top of the pressure from existing home-owners not to suffer falls in the value of their homes, and from house- builders anxious to keep the party going, H2B creates another political imperative to keep the bubble inflating – avoiding impairment of the government’s H2B loans.

Title: El Salvador's experience of UN peacebuilding reveals the ineffectiveness of 'development as usual' approaches
Word count: 1156
Abstract: To provide the vital "peace dividend" of better lives and livelihoods, peacebuilding must promote conflict-sensitive policies even where they are economically second-best. The UN can support this process by helping states in transition to reactivate their economies in an inclusive and sustainable manner, writes Graciana del Castillo (City University of New York)
basic similarity: 0.14508820495757624
basic summary: And even those that achieved a tenuous peace ended up highly aid dependent, often even for basic food needs. Lacking support, former combatants had to abandon programmes like arms-for-land that had given them a stake, however small, in the peace process.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.2564239677274669
sim_matrix summary: With the country at the brink of war only nine months after the peace agreement of January 1992, El Salvador provided early evidence of many of obstacles to peacebuilding that would later plague transitions to peace elsewhere in the world. The path to peace dividends With El Salvador now considered by most accounts a failed state, the lesson for the UN, as well as for Colombia and other countries undergoing transitions to peace, is that economic reconstruction of war-torn societies is not “development as usual”.
text_rank similarity: 0.23227203707328817
text_rank summary: Essentially, El Salvador showed that when economic reconstruction took place alongside efforts at national reconciliation and major reforms to politics and security, it was fundamentally different from “development as usual”.This two-way relationship between security and economy – often neglected by the UN in favour of a greater focus on human rights, elections, and gender issues – has proved to be a major obstacle to successful and sustainable transitions to peace, stability, and improved welfare.

Title: The hidden costs of research assessment exercises: the curious case of Australia
Word count: 1309
Abstract: Research assessment exercises provide the government and wider public with assurance of the quality of university research, with the guiding principles being accountability, transparency, and openness. But is there the same accountability and openness when it comes to the public cost of these large-scale exercises? Ksenia Sawczak examines the situation in Australia as the research sector looks ahead to the new Engagement and Impact Assessment later this year. There seems little doubt this exercise will demand significant resources, with no guarantee it will achieve its stated goal of improving how universities engage with industry. Until the hidden costs of assessment exercises are revealed and a thorough consideration of their general utility is undertaken, questions will remain as to whether they are a responsible use of public monies

basic summary: There seems little doubt this exercise will demand significant resources, with no guarantee it will achieve its stated goal of improving how universities engage with industry. What is curious about Australia is that ERA functions in a vacuum, conducted by government but playing no role in informing federal research policy or funding allocations to universities. The authors of the NISA boldly stated that an exercise of this kind will ultimately lead to improvements in how universities engage with industry.

sim_matrix summary: But for an exercise so firmly grounded in principles of accountability, transparency, and openness with the public – something particularly evident in prefaces to the National Reports the ARC releases after each ERA, which strongly emphasise the importance of assuring the public of the value of government investment in research – the missing element is the public cost of such an endeavour. To further complicate matters, the ARC has decided to follow in the footsteps of the UK’s Research Evaluation Framework by conducting a new assessment exercise this year – the Engagement and Impact Assessment. Across Australia, universities are in the throes of pulling together submissions to Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA) – the comprehensive assessment exercise, overseen by the Australian Research Council (ARC), which serves as a stocktake of all research conducted in Australian universities. For some time, the Australian government has been strongly concerned about the benefits of university-generated research beyond academia, leading to this new assessment exercise being announced as part of its 2015 National Innovation and Science Agenda. Until the hidden costs of assessment exercises in Australia are revealed and a thorough consideration of their general utility is undertaken, they will remain an international curiosity, with the dubious honour of serving as an example of assessment for the sake of assessment and irresponsible use of public monies.
text_rank similarity: 0.6032130790855433
text_rank summary: While it is not known what this will entail (and questions of privacy have been raised as matters of concern), it is clear the ARC is committed to making sure the public has as much information as possible on how universities are performing across disciplines and across different elements of the exercise.In spite of this and the many other concerns raised by universities about the burden associated with a new exercise, the Engagement and Impact Assessment is well and truly underway.This was never more apparent than in a subtle change made by the ARC to guidelines for the 2018 round that has implications with regard to openness, yet nearly went unnoticed; namely, the decision not to collect information from universities on the amount of time spent on preparing submissions.Thus, the end result is a complex exercise comprising four pieces of narrative for each discipline: an explanation of the engagement activities undertaken during the reference period which underpin the data a context for the engagement data (it’s not really clear what the ARC wants to see here, but presumably it is a statement that further describes the data which would obviously make no sense to evaluators if looked at in isolation) an impact study a detailed statement on approaches to impact (which will probably, by nature, end up repeating much of the engagement element).But for an exercise so firmly grounded in principles of accountability, transparency, and openness with the public – something particularly evident in prefaces to the National Reports the ARC releases after each ERA, which strongly emphasise the importance of assuring the public of the value of government investment in research – the missing element is the public cost of such an endeavour.

Title: Looming REF deadlines lead to a rush in publication of lower quality research
Word count: 1280
Abstract: The increased significance of research assessments and their implications for funding and career prospects has had a knock-on effect on academic publication patterns. Moqi Groen-Xu, Pedro A. Teixeira, Thomas Voigt and Bernhard Knapp report on research that reveals a marked increase in research productivity immediately prior to an evaluation deadline, which quickly reverses once the deadline has passed. Moreoever, the quality of papers published just before deadlines is lower, as measured by citations. Those who design research assessments should consider having cycles of varying lengths across different fields, affording researchers the time and opportunity to pursue more novel, risky projects
basic similarity: 0.4348233791681363
basic summary: Our research indicates that research output does indeed change around the time researchers are submitted to assessment exercises. Those who design research assessments should consider having cycles of varying lengths across different fields, affording researchers the time and opportunity to pursue more novel, risky projects. After our research was reported on the Times Higher Education, Steven Hill – Head of Research Policy at HEFCE – raised concerns about our interpretation of the findings. Because older papers had more time to accumulate citations, information about them is more precise at that time, thus biasing the choice of older articles with higher citation counts.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.38216974100200446
sim_matrix summary: The variance in journal impact factor is higher for papers published just after the deadline, indicating that researchers did not just time their publications accordingly but possibly also pursued more novel and uncertain research projects when further from the deadline. Our research indicates that research output does indeed change around the time researchers are submitted to assessment exercises. This should allow departments with longer research cycles to pursue a more important research agenda. However, we actually observe a higher variance of quality in research published further from the deadline.

Title: EU Withdrawal Agreement: the real losers will be British businesses and British citizens
Word count: 1299
Abstract: When Britain leaves the EU in March 2019, will it become isolated and not influential, to paraphrase Sir John Major's words from his speech last week? In this blog, Monica Horten (LSE) investigates the Transition chapter of the EU Withdrawal Agreement and scrutinises how far Britain's influence could be written out from the very start
basic similarity: 0.31325011796434793
basic summary: Being involved in the expert groups and the committees, and the working groups is an essential element of influencing Brussels policy and staying in the know. British representatives will be shut out of Commission expert groups that discuss policy issues across the board from copyright and banking to food standards and fake news.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.39505143746276783
sim_matrix summary: The two draft texts on the table suggest that  EU rules will continue to apply in Britain during the Transition period and that all trade agreements concluded by the European Union and which Britain currently benefits from, will continue to apply. Britain – its government, businesses and individuals such as academics, NGOs and researchers – could be excluded from EU decision-making bodies, agencies and expert groups from 29 March 2019 during the Transition period.

Title: The UK government is shedding some of its illusions about Brexit, and softening its position
Word count: 1040
Abstract: Step by step, the UK government is shedding some of its illusions about Brexit, argues Holger Schmieding (Berenberg). The United Kingdom has already accepted that it will have to meet the legally binding financial commitments it incurred while it was a member of the European Union (the so-called Brexit bill) and is going along with the EU's timetable for negotiations (divorce issues first, transition deal next, outlines of a future trade deal last). Last Friday saw another set of concessions being made by the Prime Minister
basic similarity: 0.29300883254900806
basic summary: Under such a deal, the UK would maintain access to the EU’s single market for goods and for some services on almost the same preferential terms as before. The only practical way in which Brexit could be reversed would be if early new elections swept a Labour-led government to power that might possibly call a new referendum. However, Theresa May is not yet close to such a deal that would minimise the economic damage to the UK.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.4964065301226049
sim_matrix summary: The only way to draw hope from the Mansion House speech is to view it as just one of many steps on the long road from British Brexit illusions to an acceptance of reality: the UK government can either insist on its positions and suffer a hard Brexit without a significant deal with the EU or accept the terms for a preferential market access agreement that the EU can offer – or possibly reconsider Brexit once it has become fully clear what Brexit will entail in practice. If Theresa May continues to ditch one illusion after the other, making the UK position progressively more realistic without shattering her fractious government in the process, the UK may still end up with the semi-soft or soft Brexit that minimises the economic damage for the UK. As a result, any deal will reflect the bargaining position of the EU much more than the wishes of the UK government.

In her speech at Mansion House last Friday, Prime Minister Theresa May went one step further, acknowledging that the UK has to face “hard facts” on Brexit and that “life is going to be different after Brexit”. If we extrapolate the British learning curve into the future, reason may still prevail in the end with an agreement on a “soft” or “semi-soft” Brexit by October 2018, in time for both sides to ratify it before the UK formally leaves the EU on 29 March 2019.

The dispute settlement body may rule that the US measures comply with WTO rules and open the floodgates for other countries to follow suit and use the national security safeguard to engage in hidden protectionism.

Title: The spectre of automation? Three strategies to ensure automation works for the common good
Word count: 925
Abstract: Could the consequences of automation lead to the growth of communism, as Mark Carney has warned? Mathew Lawrence writes that deep technological change opens up two divergent paths: one where technologies are managed and owned to our collective advancement against one where they deepen inequalities. He draws on IPPR research to outline three strategies that will ensure automation works for the common good
basic similarity: 0.5653103131319904
basic summary: Managed well, automation could build a future of shared economic plenty, the productivity gains of technological change allowing us all to live better and more freely. Mathew Lawrence writes that deep technological change opens up two divergent paths: one where technologies are managed and owned to our collective advancement against one where they deepen inequalities. To address this, the more rapid adoption of digital technologies, including automation, should become one of the national ‘missions’ of the government’s industrial strategy.

IPPR’s report on managing automation set out three core strategies to ensure it works for the common good.

text_rank summary: Nonetheless, the governor of the Bank of England was right to argue the accelerating capability of automating technologies could shake foundational economic and social assumptions: the role of employment as the primary means of distributing economic reward, labour’s position as the central factor in production, notions of scarcity, and how we organise working time, among others.Managed well, automation could build a future of shared economic plenty, the productivity gains of technological change allowing us all to live better and more freely.Second, as the fallout from Facebook’s actions continue, it is clear we need to act to ensure the ethical and regulatory architecture shaping the use of digital technologies is publicly determined, not left in the hands of tech giants.

frequency summary: To make sure that the dividends of automation are broadly shared, we need new models of ownership that hold wealth in common and democratise capital at scale.These could include a Citizens’ Wealth Fund that owns a broad portfolio of assets on behalf of the public and pays out a universal capital dividend and the creation of employee ownership trusts to give workers a stronger stake in the firms for which they work – and an ownership claim on the value they help create. When considering the divergent paths deep technological change is opening up – a world where technologies are managed and owned to our collective advancement against one where they deepen inequalities of power and reward – we have one political choice confronting us: socialism or barbarism. It should focus on the adoption of digital and other technologies for firms in the non- frontier ‘everyday economy’, where technological adoption rates are low, and support ordinary workers to develop and implement technological solutions.

Title: Will Polish nationals feel at home in Scotland after Brexit?
Word count: 1297
Abstract: How does it feel to be a Polish national in Scotland after the EU referendum? Kate Botterill (Edinburgh Napier University) discusses how the result and subsequent uncertainty affected them, and the strategies they have adopted to deal with it. Post-Brexit, the Scottish Government want a different approach to migration from the rest of the UK, which may lead to stronger identification with Scotland among many Poles living in the country. Nonetheless, Scottish public attitudes towards migration appear to be hardening

basic summary: So even though so many people voted to remain, I’m looking at the streets and I feel anger and I feel hatred… And I have an accent. Given these challenges, will changing Scotland’s narrative on migration be enough to make EU citizens feel at home? This research raises key questions about how Polish nationals are negotiating belonging in Scotland through broader affiliations with Europe, and often away from Poland. When it comes to migration, Scotland is widely considered to be on a different political journey to the rest of the UK.

Title: The crisis in social care is connected to the gendered inadequacy of labour law
Word count: 1218
Abstract: Lydia Hayes writes that social care is a feminist issue. Highlighting some of the appalling conditions that care workers tolerate, she explains how employment law fails to protect women's employment and to value feminised labour. She concludes that unless social care provision is revolutionised, women will have little choice but to serve as unpaid carers: stuck at home, excluded from public life, and denied life choices
basic similarity: 0.22275951470506908
basic summary: Until the wages of care workers are free from sexist devaluation, and until the work of care workers is fully recognised, the labour of all women is devalued. The inadequacy of minimum wage law The financial crisis of 2007/2008 heralded UK labour market changes in which care work became the largest source of low-waged work for women. Care workers are failed by the current right to a minimum wage where their work is not recognised as ‘work’ for the purposes of statutory pay protection.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.33128680985286757
sim_matrix summary: When the social care minimum wage scandal of 2017 highlighted that thousands of care workers were paid nothing more than pocket-money to ensure the overnight well-being of vulnerable adults, employers were outraged that they should have to pay care workers what was legally owed. Until the wages of care workers are free from sexist devaluation, and until the work of care workers is fully recognised, the labour of all women is devalued. If we continue to tolerate care workers being employed to work without pay, the future of care work will be based on sexist expectations that care work should be done for free.
text_rank similarity: 0.2660912497754552
text_rank summary: Although the right to a minimum wage was supposed to prevent exploitation, it has become standard industry practice for care workers to work for free during increasingly large parts of each working day.A sex- based ideology about women’s subservience to the needs of others still circulates in the contemporary labour market, and minimum wage law does not do enough to assert the value of care work.If we continue to tolerate care workers being employed to work without pay, the future of care work will be based on sexist expectations that care work should be done for free.
frequency similarity: 0.21680199997775437
frequency summary: Inadequacies in equal pay law perpetuate the historic subordination of women in low-waged work, prevent care workers from achieving economic independence, and exemplify the economic invisibility of skills and abilities which are thought to arise ‘naturally’ in women. Care workers are failed by the current right to a minimum wage where their work is not recognised as ‘work’ for the purposes of statutory pay protection. Where women do not work in close proximity to men, equal pay law offers very little and prevents women from comparing their wages to those of men who do not work for the same employer.

Title: High prices, not waste or over-use, drive high health care costs in the US
Word count: 881
Abstract: The US spends nearly 18 percent of its GDP on health care, making it a real outlier among high-income countries in this area. But what is behind this unusually high level of health care spending? Irene Papanicolas investigates common beliefs about why spending is so high, including that US residents use more health care services, have poorer quality of care, and use 'too much' inpatient care. She finds that higher costs in the US are largely driven by higher prices across a wide range of health care services such as surgical procedures and drugs, as well as administrative complexity and costs
basic similarity: 0.5571066253885557
basic summary: The data suggest two main factors drive health care spending in the US: higher prices across a wide range of health care services and administrative complexity and costs. Evidence: The US has among the lowest proportion of health care spending on inpatient services (19 percent) and among the highest for outpatient services (42 percent). While low social spending may contribute to poorer population health outcomes, it is unlikely a primary driver of higher health care spending. Belief 1: The US spends more than other countries because US residents consume much more health care services.

The US also pays considerably more on administration costs as compared to other systems, at about 8 percent of total health care spending (compared to a mean of 3 percent in other countries). She finds that higher costs in the US are largely driven by higher prices across a wide range of health care services such as surgical procedures and drugs, as well as administrative complexity and costs.

Title: How we can preserve assisted housing in the context of gentrification and constrained federal resources
Word count: 1239
Abstract: Like many American cities, Washington DC is experiencing a squeeze in its affordable housing: population increases and declining stocks of government subsidized housing are making it harder for low-income households to find somewhere to live. In new research, Kathryn Howell looks at how existing assisted housing in Washington, DC is being preserved in the face of gentrification and funding challenges. She writes that preservation is a long and complex process that engages diverse stakeholders from tenants and tenant organizers to local and federal agency staff
basic similarity: 0.4912927530547169
basic summary: This case offers powerful support for increased collaboration between stakeholders and meaningful local laws and flexible funding for the preservation of affordable housing. But developing new funding sources and programs for the complex process of preservation requires multiple private and government stakeholders, shared governance and access to data. She writes that preservation is a long and complex process that engages diverse stakeholders from tenants and tenant organizers to local and federal agency staff.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.4140020542281627
sim_matrix summary: The DC Preservation Network is a monthly meeting of preservation stakeholders from tenant organizers to federal government staff. These stakeholders used a mix local policies, including local tenant protections, flexible funding sources such as DC’s Housing Production Trust Fund, and laws that enabled access to the housing market such as the Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act, which gives tenants the right of first refusal when their building is for sale. One example of the process for preservation and loss is Museum Square Apartments in Washington, DC.

text_rank summary: Federal resources have declined for 40 years in the United States, leaving many cities and states, regardless of the market, at a loss to support the development and preservation of affordable housing.However, the Museum Square One case is just one example of the way affordable housing leaves the subsidized stock, as well as the efforts made by a broad group of stakeholders to try to preserve it.Many cities – like the District of Columbia – have begun to understand that production of units using federal funds only approaches a portion of the problem in the face of the growth in many US cities that has made neighbourhoods unaffordable for low- and moderate-income households.

In Washington, buildings were tracked by the preservation network for an average of 16 months before they were lost – many of those buildings had been tracked multiple times by the group, suggesting that there are clear opportunities for stakeholders to engage with the building owner, residents and funders. Because of the diverse scale impacts of affordable housing – city, neighbourhood, building and tenant – as well as the dimensions of funding, code enforcement and daily living, there must be an avenue through which data can be shared to create a more complete picture of the building’s status.

Abstract: In Colonial Captivity during the First World War: Internment and the Fall of the German Empire, 1914-1919, Mahon Murphy offers a comprehensive study of the experiences of the 20,000 Germans in colonies who spent in time in Allied captivity during World War One. This is an impressive analysis that uses internment as a prism to examine the War’s extra-European theatres, underscoring the conflict’s global dimensions and critically examining imperial notions of race, writes Joshua Smeltzer
basic similarity: 0.3922700811224832
basic summary: Indeed, Murphy’s narrative firmly establishes an interconnected web of camps, implicated in imperial notions of race and shaped by a common European civilising mission. At the outbreak of World War One, the British swiftly repatriated Germans from Cameroon and Togo, while transferring combatants and males of military age to camps in Britain.

text_rank summary: Thus, we learn that German officers were often interned in separate camps away from enlisted soldiers; that women were considered ‘the embodiment of would be Deutschtum (“Germanness”) in Africa’ and were therefore ‘expected to provide a moral example for young adventurous men who were said to lose their morals once separated from Europe’ (112-13); and that the treatment of German Askari – African auxiliary troops used by the Germans – was largely mediated by British concerns regarding their own ‘imperial image’ and ‘postwar concerns for the establishment of British influence in the former German colonies’ (119).Murphy shows that even after the end of the war, Germans were largely prevented from returning to the colonies out of a fear that their return would, following the words of a British War Cabinet memorandum of 1919, create ‘grave internal disorder and possibly bloodshed’ in the colonies (200).

Abstract: The recent allegations against Oxfam employees in Haiti sparked a series of reports about misconduct within major charities, which in turn raised serious questions about accountability in the NGO sector.

Title: A coercive policy-making state? How the EU is alienating its citizens
Word count: 1284
Abstract: The remit of EU institutions has expanded inexorably, writes Jeremy Richardson, all while their policy-making style has shifted from a consensus-based process towards a more coercive, top-down one. At the same time, the EU's focus on interest groups might have also exacerbated the problem of the democratic deficit by distancing the EU from broader public opinion. These realities have contributed to both Brexit and the broader 'populist revolt' across Member States

Title: Critical actors and abortion law: a group of individuals in Northern Irish politics obstructs change
Word count: 965
Abstract: There are various reasons why progress on legal abortion in Northern Ireland has been blocked over the years. Key among them is that individual politicians rule out any suggestion of change, writes Jennifer Thomson. She argues that more attention should be given to the actions of individual actors, considering their role can often be as important as that of political parties or institutions
basic similarity: 0.3653035509601473
basic summary: Feminist political scientists have long employed the concept of ‘critical actors’ to refer to key individuals who instigate positive change within political institutions. Attempts to change abortion policy at the moment are also not helped by the fact that Northern Ireland is facing one of its most challenging political periods in decades. When considering why some policies are difficult to change, or even to implement at all, consideration must be given to the actions of individual members of political institutions.

sim_matrix summary: Abortion in particular has long been a political football in Northern Irish politics following devolution. Attempts to change abortion policy at the moment are also not helped by the fact that Northern Ireland is facing one of its most challenging political periods in decades. For much of Northern Ireland’s devolved period therefore, abortion has been a political stumbling block.

Although Northern Irish women can now access abortions on the NHS in England, thanks to Stella Creasy’s amendment to the Queen’s speech, this does nothing to change the strict legal situation in Northern Ireland, nor does it help with the financial costs of travelling for the procedure. Indeed, in the wake of the DUP confidence and supply arrangement with Theresa May’s government, much was made of the DUP’s social conservatism in the British press and Northern Ireland’s variance from the rest of the UK.

Abstract: Following on from his previous analysis on why city centrism has not turned out to be a panacea for urban development so far, Andy Pike argues it is time for fresh thinking. He explains why we need to find better ways to think about and design policies that support the combination of the dynamism of Britain's city centres

Title: In Congressional races, political networks play an important role in ensuring minority representation
Word count: 1198
Abstract: A number of retirements in Congress ahead of the 2018 midterms have opened up the possibility for increased Latino representation in the US House of Representatives. But, the past has shown that Latino candidates aren't always selected for, or win elections in, majority Latino districts and that Latinos and non-Latinos who are elected don't always represent the views of their constituents. In new research, Angela X. Ocampo finds that political networks have a large influence on whether a Latino or non-Latino gets onto the ballot as a candidate. These networks are also often able to push candidates forward based on their legislative priorities, which may or may not align with the preferences of their constituents
basic similarity: 0.527161883329931
basic summary: This article is based on the paper The Wielding Influence of Political Networks: Representation in Majority- Latino Districts in Political Research Quarterly (PRQ). Lastly, the evidence showed that lack of coordination and fragmentation among existent political networks paved the way for the emergence of non-Latino candidates in majority-Latino districts. Political networks were also critical in narrowing down candidate fields when announced Latino and non-Latino candidates might weaken the chances of one another. The dataset included vote turns, candidate and district demographics and financial contributions made by the candidates themselves, individuals, parties and groups.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.4798051111031648
sim_matrix summary: Political networks were also critical in narrowing down candidate fields when announced Latino and non-Latino candidates might weaken the chances of one another. I investigated the activities of political networks in majority-Latino districts to understand why some districts are able to elect Latino representatives and some are not. I also compiled a dataset of the Latino and non-Latino candidates running in all open-seat congressional races from 2004 to 2014 that had a Latino population plurality. All of this suggests that political networks matter a great deal in shaping Latino descriptive and substantive representation.

text_rank summary: Political networks were also critical in narrowing down candidate fields when announced Latino and non-Latino candidates might weaken the chances of one another.For example, the evidence from Arizona’s 7th congressional district clearly showed that the candidates who were running in this district were supported by very different factions of the Democratic Party with distinct policy agendas.The dataset included vote turns, candidate and district demographics and financial contributions made by the candidates themselves, individuals, parties and groups.Obtained through a simulation from one of my models, Figure 1 below shows the predicted probability of a Latino candidate winning in a majority- Latino open-seat as a function of contributions from committees and parties, versus individual-level contributions, while holding all other candidate and district level variables constant.

frequency summary: This article is based on the paper The Wielding Influence of Political Networks: Representation in Majority- Latino Districts in Political Research Quarterly (PRQ). Furthermore, it is also not necessarily the case that representatives emerging out of districts with a majority Latino population will substantively represent their Latino constituents, as was the case with Rep. Gary Miller (R) in California’s 31st Congressional district in 2012. However, as Rep. Green’s case in Texas 29th Congressional district suggests, it is not always the case that a Latino representative achieves victory in a district with a large Latino constituency. Lastly, the evidence showed that lack of coordination and fragmentation among existent political networks paved the way for the emergence of non-Latino candidates in majority-Latino districts.

Ben Margulies writes that the treatment of these students echoes the way whites treat non-white political opponents: often as ‘enemies’ or ‘aliens’ who are unworthy of civil discourse

basic summary: Ben Margulies writes that the treatment of these students echoes the way whites treat non-white political opponents: often as ‘enemies’ or ‘aliens’ who are unworthy of civil discourse. There is little new to say about the United States’ unique gun culture, or about the grievous impact that this culture has on public safety in the country.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.3262029488710288
sim_matrix summary: What is new – at least among white American students – is the wave of gun-control activism that has swept American schools, including Douglas itself. To put it another way, in moments of extreme polarization, each political camp may start treating its opponents as enemy combatants, rather than fellow citizens, and in the United States, such treatment is likely to echo – however distantly – the way whites treat non-white political opponents.

Title: UK governance after Brexit: yet more variable and even more disjointed
Word count: 1153
Abstract: Michael Kenny and Jack Sheldon write that, although May's government has been prepared to make various concessions in its dealings with the devolved governments, tricky intergovernmental negotiations relating to Brexit are in line. How these will be managed will be one of the most difficult aspects of the Brexit process
basic similarity: 0.23939171800432077
basic summary: Its original draft would have prevented the devolved administrations from legislating in all areas currently covered by EU law until the long-term allocation of powers was agreed. In the scenario that no deal is reached, the Scottish and Welsh governments would seek to pass their ‘continuity bills’.

sim_matrix summary: These seek to incorporate EU law into devolved law, meaning that if it pressed ahead with enacting its Withdrawal Bill without the consent of the parliaments of Scotland and Wales, the UK government would be tearing up one of the core conventions of the devolution settlement and entering unchartered constitutional waters. The speech also included a low-key, but notable, shift in policy as he revealed that the government would work on the presumption that devolved powers should remain devolved once Brexit happens (rather than being held initially by the UK government).

Title: EU students at UK universities: patterns and trends
Word count: 624
Abstract: What Brexit will mean for UK universities varies from institution to institution. Much data on Brexit's impact focuses on sector-wide aggregates, the forest that hides the trees. The UK provides excellent teaching and research, as illustrated by the number of its universities ranked in the top 10, 50 or 100 in the world. Yet despite its world-class reputation, the UK's higher education sector is hierarchical, and various layers will be affected differently. Ludovic Highman (UCL) explores the sector’s diversity in this regard
basic similarity: 0.35516927936380516
basic summary: Currently they are treated as home students, but in all likelihood EU students enrolling in the UK after its withdrawal in March 2019 will be treated as overseas students. The diversity of the student fabric of UK universities, so crucial to the overall student experience, depends on a healthy number of non-UK based students interacting with domestic students. Scottish universities are attractive to non-UK EU students in absolute numbers, with Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen attracting more than Oxbridge and competing with the top London universities. EU students graduate from rigorous secondary school systems and their drive to study abroad, most often in a language that is not theirs, makes them attractive to UK universities. It is possible that higher concentrations of EU students will further relocate to Scotland, though this depends on the level of fees charged beyond 2020.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.3906230148169304
sim_matrix summary: Under the current tuition fee system, Scottish universities will remain attractive to prospective EU students, while many of their English counterparts (outside London and Oxbridge) that already have lower proportions of EU students will be less attractive if non-UK EU students lose their current status, comparatively-speaking. The tuition fee regime seems to have an impact on the choice of destination, as suggested by the high numbers and ratios of EU students in Scottish universities, while London as a global city attracts the most EU students. While the London Russell Group universities have the highest numbers of non-UK EU students (with UCL ahead, followed by King’s), and Oxbridge remains firmly cemented within the top 10, the data also demonstrate the attractiveness of Scottish universities, and the subsequent relative drop in the number of non-UK EU students in English universities that are not located in global cities such as Birmingham, London, or Manchester, or academic powerhouses such as Oxford and Cambridge. EU students tend to enrol in Russell Group universities. This is partly explained by the lack of tuition fees for non- UK EU students in Scotland.

Title: The more revisions a paper undergoes, the greater its subsequent recognition in terms of citations
Word count: 1257
Abstract: Is the peer review process simply a means by which errors are identified and corrected? Or is it a process in which a more constructive dialogue can take place and reviewers and editors may actively contribute to the text? John Rigby, Deborah Cox and Keith Julian have studied the published articles of a social sciences journal and found that the more revisions a paper undergoes, the greater its subsequent recognition in terms of citations
basic similarity: 0.24721271005187898
basic summary: Peer review needs to be recognised not as an event but as a process, often a long one, and one in which a constructive dialogue can take place. Our paper is part of a long-running effort to open the “black box” of peer review. Our work throws up an interesting paradox – at least an interesting paradox for those who hold that peer review is error correction.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.4319752328691875
sim_matrix summary: If we consider that peer review is simple error removal, the reviewing effort variable in our analysis (the number of times a paper is revised) would either have no statistical relationship with the outcome variable or, as is more likely, it would have a negative relationship in that papers requiring more work at first review (a higher reviewer input) would have less recognition and general interest ultimately as such papers contained more errors to begin with. And while a number of contributors to this debate have noted the role of journal peer review in improving the quality, none has demonstrated a statistical link between a paper’s citations and aspects of the peer review process. Under the assumption that peer review is merely error checking, this association would be a paradox which one could state thus: manuscripts at review that were thought to be in more need of correction were, at publication found to be of greater interest.

Title: It's not enough for research to be useful to policy actors, we must try to actually influence change
Word count: 1544
Abstract: There is no doubt that good communications and framing research and evidence for your audience is important to influencing policy and having research impact. But shouldn't we be aiming higher than producing and packaging research that simply meets the demands of policy actors? Surely what we actually want to do is influence change, not reinforce social and political norms? James Georgalakis argues that research and researchers need to challenge dominant paradigms and expose inconvenient truths. Relationships, networks, and bodies of knowledge play a far more significant role in change processes than short-term communications campaigns on specific research reports
basic similarity: 0.4660266580637651
basic summary: The first is the simple one favoured by research donors and think tanks that says that research, if packaged correctly, can directly “enlighten” policy actors. We try and overcome academics’ nervousness about policy engagement by demonstrating that research rigour and policy engagement can be mutually reinforcing. However, another model describes how by trying to shape research and evidence for policy we may actually allow politics to shape knowledge. Academics’ anxiety over engaging in policy, which can sometimes seem very inconvenient, centres less on the issue of measurement and more on the fundamental relationship between evidence and policy. The semi-professional disciplines of both policy influence and research impact always attract the communications crowd.

text_rank summary: A sort of research-uptake-in-reverse, where all those snazzy infographics and interactive policy reports produced by influential think tanks tell us more about particular interest groups’ politics than what an evidence-based approach to a particular area of policy might look like.It’s not enough for research to be useful to policy actors, we must try to actually influence change There is no doubt that good communications and framing research and evidence for your audience is important to influencing policy and having research impact.An emphasis on usefulness seems to suggest that measuring success comes down to how often your think tank or research organisation gets its report used, the level of positive engagement from the target audience online and in person, and the number of times journalists come to your experts for information.Relationships, networks, and bodies of knowledge play a far more significant role in change processes than short-term communications campaigns on specific research reports.However, another model describes how by trying to shape research and evidence for policy we may actually allow politics to shape knowledge.

frequency summary: About the author James Georgalakis is the Director of Communications and Impact at the Institute of Development Studies (IDS), with overall leadership of the Institute’s communications, impact and engagement work. It’s not enough for research to be useful to policy actors, we must try to actually influence change There is no doubt that good communications and framing research and evidence for your audience is important to influencing policy and having research impact. As I explored in the Social Realities of Knowledge for Development, the interaction between research and policy is deeply social and the most appropriate means of measuring your institution’s impact probably relates to changes in relationships, not column inches, tweets, or policy citations. Bodies of knowledge and relationships Relationships, networks, and bodies of knowledge play a far more significant role in change processes than short- term communications campaigns on specific reports. I am reminded of Andy Sumner’s work on the New Bottom Billion back in 2010 when IDS challenged the dominant view that development must be about tackling extreme poverty in the poorest countries.

Title: We need more carrots: give academic researchers the support and incentives to share data
Word count: 1120
Abstract: Making data available for other researchers to find, use, reuse, and reproduce is fundamental to open science, and ultimately makes research more efficient and effective. Yet despite funder policies that encourage and require data sharing, researchers in both the UK and the US report lower percentages of data sharing than the global average. In addition to progressive policies, Grace Baynes suggests researchers should be given incentives, expert support, training, and the infrastructure to make it seamless and easy to share data, and worth their while. Governments, funders, research institutions, libraries, and publishers all have a role to play to unlock the huge potential of research data

The issue for researchers may not be purely “lack of time” but “is it worth my time?” Published, citable datasets need to be viewed as research outputs on a par with a research article in terms of career advancement and assessment. For example, at Springer Nature we offer a free Research Data Support Helpdesk and recommended repositories list, as well as an optional Research Data Support service to help researchers and institutions deposit their data in repositories and make it easier to find and use. To achieve real “open science” we need to open up all areas of research, including research data.

Title: The neurotic academic: how anxiety fuels casualised academic work
Word count: 1380
Abstract: As higher education undergoes a process of marketisation in the UK and the activities of academic staff are increasingly measured and scrutinised, universities are suffused with anxiety. Coupled with pressures facing all staff, casualised academics face multiple forms of insecurity. While anxiety is often perceived as an individual problem for which employees are encouraged to take personal responsibility, Vik Loveday argues that anxiety amongst academic staff should be understood in two ways: as a symptom of casualised work in an increasingly competitive environment; and as a tactic of governance, ensuring compliance
basic similarity: 0.42852256777736447
basic summary: This blog post is based on the author’s article, “The neurotic academic: anxiety, casualisation, and governance in the neoliberalising university”, published in the Journal of Cultural Economy (DOI: 10.1080/17530350.2018.1426032). Anxiety, then, can be conceptualised as a kind of “tactic” of governance: fuelling hard work, a striving for so-called “excellence”, and the creation of obedient academic subjects. It will come as no surprise to those working in the UK’s higher education (HE) sector that universities are currently suffused with anxiety.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.4277521662824275
sim_matrix summary: Anxiety was one of the defining themes to emerge from the interviews, and – most obviously – the pervasiveness of anxiety appeared to be a kind of symptom of casualised employment within the increasingly competitive landscape of the neoliberalising sector. For those participants who had been working on multiple contracts for extended periods of time, fixed-term work had led to feelings of marginalisation and stress in the workplace and – in some serious cases – mental ill-health. In addition to pressures facing many staff in universities – such as time- management, meeting growing employer expectations, and the evaluation of performance – “casualised” contracts present particular challenges for those facing employment uncertainty: in a material sense, this can be a case of keeping up with regular payments for rent and bills, or providing for dependents; on a day-to-day basis, time is spent juggling existing contracts with job applications and interviews, whilst acknowledging that planning for the future often seems unthinkable – even farcical – in the face of the unknown.
text_rank similarity: 0.4231945097692811
text_rank summary: Far from providing convenient flexibility, the participants in my research felt as though they had very little control over their working lives apart from the possibility of “working on the self” – taking personal responsibility for productivity, success, and “excellence” through the pursuit of student satisfaction, publications, or external funding, which was often achieved through chronic over-work fuelled by anxiety, but with no financial security or guarantee of permanent work at the end of contracts.While anxiety is quite clearly an effect of the conditions under which it is produced, during the project I began to turn my attention to what anxiety itself might be achieving: in the first instance, anxiety can be seen as a symptom of precarious work, which affected the participants on an individual basis; yet their narratives also pointed to the more active role that anxiety played in the quest to find work and the forging of an “entrepreneurial academic self” appropriate to the demands of an increasingly competitive sector.The “privatisation of stress” involves a shift from examining the wider conditions under which we labour to a focus on the self, and the stressed-out figure of the casualised “neurotic academic” points not only to the personal but also the political costs of failing to resist processes that are detrimental to the health of staff and the wellbeing of the public university.

Title: PhD students supervised collectively rather than individually are quicker to complete their theses
Word count: 1366
Abstract: Given the choice, most PhD students would prefer to receive individual supervision rather than be supervised alongside their peers as part of a collective. This is understandable, given the undivided attention and precise, directly relevant advice one would receive. However, Hans Agné and Ulf Mörkenstam have compared the experiences of individually and collectively supervised students on the same doctoral programme and found that collective supervision, during the first year at least, is correlated with significantly shorter times to thesis completion compared to individual supervision
basic similarity: 0.4428941621617673
basic summary: Studied in this way, it appears that collective supervision of first-year doctoral students is correlated with significantly shorter times to thesis completion compared to individual supervision. Students who received collective supervision in the first year averaged 57 months in the programme, while students receiving individual supervision averaged 92 months. Multivariate statistical analyses of these observations support the conclusion that collective supervision in the first year does indeed reduce the time to completion of doctoral students.

sim_matrix summary: When it comes to assisting doctoral students to complete their theses on time or even as quickly as possible, this research has led us to believe that collective supervision in the first year of study significantly out-performs individual supervision. Studied in this way, it appears that collective supervision of first-year doctoral students is correlated with significantly shorter times to thesis completion compared to individual supervision. For example, it is well-known that time to doctoral completion depends on funding opportunities, the academic discipline, and the integration of doctoral students into ongoing research projects.

Title: Svexit or Huxit? How another country could follow the UK out of the EU
Word count: 1656
Abstract: What are the chances of another country following the UK out of the EU? Eurosceptics in other states may be emboldened by the deal the UK manages to secure, especially if it includes access to the Single Market. Moves to further EU integration could have a similar effect. Simon Hix (LSE) and Nick Sitter (Central European University) look at the cases of Hungary and Sweden
basic similarity: 0.3837329547673884
basic summary: A scenario that would see Sweden as the next country to leave the EU would have to involve a substantial change in the cross-party political consensus on European integration. The most realistic basis for such a scenario would involve the emergence of a model of European integration that is more attractive for Sweden than full EU membership. Should Brexit lead to a new model that is more attractive than the EEA, the benefits of EU membership might seem less obvious. Second, a successful soft Brexit could conceivably provide an attractive alternative to full EU membership.

sim_matrix summary: If Hungary loses EU subsidies, the benefits of EU membership (to the government) would be dramatically reduced. Having said that, support for the EU is volatile in both countries, and how Brexit plays out and how the EU responds internally to Brexit will influence the direction of travel for the publics and political parties in these two countries. Second, a successful soft Brexit could conceivably provide an attractive alternative to full EU membership. The most realistic basis for such a scenario would involve the emergence of a model of European integration that is more attractive for Sweden than full EU membership.

text_rank summary: A scenario that would see Sweden as the next country to leave the EU would have to involve a substantial change in the cross-party political consensus on European integration.A key difference between Britain and the next member state to leave is that the next exit is more likely to result from cold calculation of the costs and benefits of EU membership rather than a miscalculation by a prime minister and a country’s political establishment.A soft Brexit that leaves the UK with substantial access to the Single European Market, but does not cross Theresa May’s red lines in terms of budget contributions, free movement and the reach of the EU judiciary, might be the Conservative party’s dream for Britain.In the midst of the rather shambolic Brexit process, and with the growing recognition of the potentially huge economic costs of leaving the EU single market and customs union, it might seem an inopportune time to ask who will be next to leave the EU.
frequency similarity: 0.5712680296045533
frequency summary: Even a “hard Brexit”, along the lines of a Canada-style free trade agreement with zero tariffs and zero quotas on goods, could provide a model for trade in goods that protect German carmakers’ presence in Hungary, and thus could allow Hungary to exit the EU without undue damage to one of its main expert industries. This “British model” may start to become attractive to some current member states, who may assume they could avoid some of the costs the UK has gone through in the Brexit process, and jump straight to the final settlement deal for the UK. However painful Brexit may seem for the UK in the short- or medium-term, once the relationship between the UK and EU has been partially settled (it will of course be an ongoing settlement), there will be a new “off the shelf” association for others to consider: a “British model”, in addition to the existing Norwegian, Swiss, Canadian, Turkish, Ukrainian, and so on. A soft Brexit that leaves the UK with substantial access to the Single European Market, but does not cross Theresa May’s red lines in terms of budget contributions, free movement and the reach of the EU judiciary, might be the Conservative party’s dream for Britain.

Title: Metrics Mania: The Case Against Academia.edu
Word count: 1423
Abstract: Academia.edu has been called "Facebook for academics," and the analogy is fitting: Academia.edu mimics core social-media conventions, down to follower counts, curated profiles with pics, and a scrollable "News Feed" bulletin of followers’ uploads. But its reliance on user-facing metrics exceeds anything you’ll find on mainstream social media. It comes with a dedicated "Analytics" page resembling a gaming leaderboard or a corporation’s annual report. The charts and graphs encourage incessant monitoring, which dovetails with university policies that seek to measure quantifiable "impact." The result? Scholars are internalizing an analytics mind-set
basic similarity: 0.3342331147325014
basic summary: Scholars upload their paywalled papers, which become Google-indexed PDFs; the company uses these to draw in new members; the audience increases, prompting more scholars to upload their work. t most universities, annual evaluations and tenure decisions hinge on numbers: article counts, journal impact factors, h-index scores, and, perhaps, standardized teaching evaluations. This essay is based on an article, written with Brooke Erin Duffy, an assistant professor of communication at Cornell University, that recently appeared in Social Media + Society. With the audit culture lodged inside us, we don’t even need a warped incentive structure to overproduce papers and game the numbers. But now Academia.edu invites us to measure ourselves — to incorporate page views and download counts into our intellectual identities. "Academia is the easiest way to share papers with millions of people across the world for free," proclaims the site.

Title: Effects of the concentration of solids on the phenomenon of super-elevation in artificial curved open channels
Word count: 1594
Abstract: This present study analyses the effects of the concentration of solids in the over-elevation phenomenon in a canalwith a 180° curvature and a constant trapezoidal transversal section, with a firm bed, the fluid has a non-colloidal,mono-disperse distribution of relatively spherical particles of 1mm in size, thus making the rheology of the flow de-scribable by the Einstein-Roscoe equation (1). Two stages are proposed for the development of the research; the firstcorresponds to physical experimentation, achieved using an artificial canal, in which 420 tests were carried out usingdifferent concentration of solids and two slopes, in order to determine the behaviour of the bi-phased flow. All of thisis carried out by using experimental results and results obtained from numerical models. The data collected from theexperimental process is compared to the results obtained from the theoretical models that are reported in literature.An over-elevation equation was formulated from the analysis, which can be used for the bi-phased conditions de-scribed in this article. During the second phase, numerical modelling using the TITAN2F software was carried out,where laboratory conditions are replicated. Data found from numerical modelling is compared with experimentalresults, with the intention of validating the numerical model that TITAN2F uses. From what is mentioned above, itwas deduced that TITAN2F effectively reproduces the hydraulic phenomenon. However, it is also observed that theprogram has a low susceptibility to changes in the concentration of solids, due to the scale being use

Para el desarrollo de la investigación se plantean dos fases; la  primera, correspondiente a experimentación física, por medio de un canal artificial, en el que se realizaron 420 ensayos  con diferentes concentraciones de sólidos y dos pendientes, para determinar el comportamiento del flujo bifásico. De lo anterior, se pudo deducir que efectivamente, TITAN2F reproduce el fenómeno  hidráulico; sin embargo, se observa que el programa tiene baja susceptibilidad a cambios de concentración de sólidos  debido a la escala utilizada. Los  datos alcanzados en el proceso experimental se comparan con los resultados obtenidos a partir de modelos teóricos  reportados en la literatura.

Title: Extending Internet to Powerless Areas
Word count: 2899
Abstract: Literature ReviewThe lack of internet in undeveloped countries and other rural areas is detrimental to the development of the area. Access to internet can have many profound effects on developing countries such as creating economic opportunities for small and medium sized businesses (Meltzer) and improving education (Purdue). In many of these rural areas and developing countries, such as Africa, children do not have up to date education (The Economist), people struggle to find jobs (ACET), and the infrastructure is lacking (The World Bank). The lack of internet in areas that have been affected by natural disasters is also a large problem that our society faces. Areas where the cellular towers and power generators were knocked out would benefit greatly from connectivity because it would allow the affected community to communicate with outside help.  One example of when internet needed to be extended to an area affected by disaster is Puerto Rico after Hurricane Irma knocked out over 90% of their cell service (Fiegerman). Some companies have attempted to create solar powered wi-fi hotspots, but none of them are implemented in the way that we plan to solve the problem. No product exists that can provide internet without cellular coverage nor a power grid. However, there are a couple of products that are in our area of research. The company Soluxio has created a solar powered wi-fi extender/LTE wi-fi hotspot. This is primarily for creating outdoor wi-fi networks in places with an existing internet connection or for resorts and city parks in developed areas where LTE data is available (Soluxio). The company Moja has created a microserver that also connects to LTE data. This device has the option to be solar powered, but it also has the same limitation as the Soluxio device in that it relies on LTE data which does not cover a large portion of the globe (Moja).

Thesis Statement Design a system/device that can provide internet to areas that do not have reliable power or cellular coverage. Solar Panel Roof Mount The roof mount design is less expensive than the pole mount design, however it can only be used in areas with the proper infrastructure. Since many use cases for our device involves disaster relief areas, the device also needs to be able to withstand very rough climates and weather conditions. Our system is capable of producing its own power and sustaining itself and even 14 some excess power to the client. Since most of the Puerto Ricans do not have power or lights still, it would be imperative to have some sort of power source functionality. Areas where the cellular towers and power generators were knocked out would benefit greatly from connectivity because it would allow the affected community to communicate with outside help. No product exists that can provide 2 internet without cellular coverage nor a power grid.

Title: Animal Languages in the Middle Ages: Representations of Interspecies Communication
Word count: 227
Abstract: The essays in this interdisciplinary volume explore language, broadly construed, as part of the continued interrogation of the boundaries of human and nonhuman animals in the Middle Ages. Uniting a diverse set of emerging and established scholars, Animal Languages questions the assumed medieval distinction between humans and other animals. The chapters point to the wealth of non-human communicative and discursive forms through which animals function both as vehicles for human meaning and as agents of their own, demonstrating the significance of human and non-human interaction in medieval texts, particularly for engaging with the Other. The book ultimately considers the ramifications of deconstructing the medieval anthropocentric view of language for the broader question of human singularity

Title: Assessment of expression of interferon γ (IFN-G) gene and its antisense (IFNG-AS1) in breast cancer
Word count: 3148
Abstract: Background  The role of long non-coding RNAs has been extensively appreciated in the contexts of cancer. Interferon γ-antisense RNA1 (IFNG-AS1) is an lncRNA located near to IFN-γ-encoding (IFNG) gene and regulates expression of IFNG in Th1 cells. Methods  In the present study, we evaluated expression of IFNG and IFNG-AS1 in 108 breast samples including tumoral tissues and their adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANCTs) using real-time PCR. IFNG-AS1 was significantly upregulated in tumoral tissues compared with ANCTs (expression ratio = 2.23, P = 0.03). Results  Although the expression of IFNG was higher in tumoral tissues compared with ANCTs (relative expression = 1.89), it did not reach the level of significance (P = 0.07). IFNG expression was significantly higher in HER2-negative tumoral tissues compared with HER2-positive ones (P = 0.01) and in grade 1 samples compared with grade 2 ones (P = 0.03). No other significant difference was found in expressions of genes between other groups. Conclusion Significant strong correlations were detected between expression of IFNG and IFNG-AS1 in both tumoral tissues and ANCTs. The present study provides evidences for participation of IFNG and IFNG-AS1 in the pathogenesis of breast cancer and warrants future studies to elaborate the underlying mechanism

basic summary: IFNG expression was significantly higher in HER2-negative tumoral tissues compared with HER2-positive ones (P = 0.01) and in grade 1 samples compared with grade 2 ones (P = 0.03). In spite of several efforts to evaluate the effi- ciency of IFN-γ treatment in breast cancer, data regarding expression of IFNG gene in breast cancer tissues is scarce. Methods: In the present study, we evaluated expression of IFNG and IFNG-AS1 in 108 breast samples including tumoral tissues and their adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANCTs) using real-time PCR. Results: Although the expression of IFNG was higher in tumoral tissues compared with ANCTs (relative expression = 1.89), it did not reach the level of significance (P = 0.07). Expression analysis Relative expressions of IFNG and IFNG-AS1 genes were assessed in tumoral tissues and paired ANCTs in the rotor gene 6000 Corbett Real-Time PCR System. Table 3 shows the results of association analysis between relative expressions of genes in tumoral tissues compared with ANCTs and patients’ clinicopath- ological data. Elevated expression of IFNG-AS1 lncRNA has been reported in Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT) patients in correlation with the proportion of circulating Th1 cells and IFNG gene expression . We compared expression level of IFNG and IFNG-AS1 in each tumoral tissue vs. its paired ANCT and classified patients based on these values to upregulation and downregulation groups. No significant associations were found between patients’ clinicopathological data and fold changes of ex- pression of these genes in tumoral tissues compared with ANCTs.

Word count: 3707
Abstract: Background and aims: The current paper aimed to collect and document the information about medicinal plants of Boyer Ahmad and Dena regions and their applications by indigenous inhabitants. Methods: The field surveys were carried out from March 2015 to September 2016 under supervision of local people. Collected plant specimens were identified to species level using Flora of Iran and Flora Iranica. Subsequently, information including scientific names, local names, parts used, method of preparation, medicinal effects, growth forms, and chorotypes for 71 species were recorded. Results: Medicinal plants belonged to 62 genera and 29 families. Apiaceae (14.08%) and Lamiaceae (14.08%) had the most number of species among other families. Based on Raunkier method, hemicryptophytes with 42.25% is the highest growth form and the most common chorotype was Irano-Turanian type (70.42%). The most used parts are aerial parts (40/85%),‎ and the most common mode of preparation was infusion (24%). The results of this study indicate that local people in Boyer Ahmad and Dena regions have used all collected plants for medicinal, food and sanitary purposes and their knowledge about identification of plants and their habitats, medicinal and edible properties is extensive. Conclusions: Native knowledge leads to obtaining valuable information including medicinal properties of plants, usable parts, time of growth, best time for harvesting and areas which have growing potential. Therefore, it is vital to investigate the native knowledge about medicinal plants in various regions of Iran
