Title: Making family: the journey into exile of a South Sudan refugee - part 2 #LSEreturn
Word count: 1695
Abstract: Through the story of Chol, LSE’s Naomi Pendle explores the meaning of exile and the lived experience of being a refugee through cycles of displacement and return. In the first article of this two-part series, Pendle tells us how Chol rebuilt home after years spent in exile. Now, LSE’s Naomi Pendle narrates Chol’s return into exile, a journey that was in itself a return and cemented his ability to build a family

basic summary: Now, LSE’s Naomi Pendle narrates Chol’s return into exile, a journey that was in itself a return and cemented his ability to build a family. It was these networks, as much as a journey to a safe space, that he sought to cement as safety for himself, his wife and his son. Yet, they knew that the journey would be fraught with dangers and force them to weave between government and rebel held territories.

sim_matrix summary: Safety for Chol was the return to northern Sudan and the familiar values of business. He feared others would advise against this journey as people had already tried to reach Khartoum and not all had been safe. Yet, they knew that the journey would be fraught with dangers and force them to weave between government and rebel held territories.

Title: Young people are highly critical of Brexit and fear the insularity it could bring
Word count: 1070
Abstract: Most young people did not support Brexit and the referendum result left many feeling frustrated and disempowered, write Shakuntala Banaji and Sam Mejias (LSE). They fear the vote will make the UK more insular and are highly critical of the way the campaign was conducted. In focus groups, they showed a strong understanding of the EU – and want a Brexit settlement that tackles inequality as well as ensuring Britain is an open and welcoming country
basic similarity: 0.32409041521935816
basic summary: A minority of respondents asserted that the referendum and subsequent events had been a ‘participation catalyst’ for young people to become more politically active. As soon as people voted leave, there were attacks on minorities…I don’t know [if] people thought it was more OK to be racist, because they were leaving [the EU]. Secondly, young people expressed dissatisfaction that the oldest generations (65+) should have such a disproportionate influence on the futures of the youngest citizens.

sim_matrix summary: With no funding, but assisted by a fantastic group of youth partners (including youth participation NGO My Life My Say and the All Party Parliamentary Group on a Better Brexit for Young People) we set up a series of focus groups across the UK to find out what young people from 13 to 30 think and feel about Brexit, and what they want out of the Brexit process. (Youth participant from Falkirk & Clackmannanshire, Scotland) Priorities and hopes It will come as no surprise then that a majority of young people in our study were adamant that they want the post- Brexit UK to be a better place than the UK is now, that they want negotiations to retain the rights and benefits associated with Europe today – freedom of movement, human and civil rights protections, subsidies, the single market – while also tackling inequality that has risen due to austerity. Although these were complex, and not a simple matter of the young ‘blaming’ everyone older than them, we were told of two levels of resentment: in the first case, young people under 18 felt deprived of a voice and overwhelmingly said that if they could, they would have voted to remain.

Title: The political significance of Poland's government reshuffle
Word count: 1984
Abstract: A sweeping reshuffle by Poland's new prime minister has changed the shape and direction of its government, with a greater emphasis being placed on economic modernisation, political stabilisation and improving EU relations. But as Aleks Szczerbiak writes, this pivot to the technocratic centre risks alienating the ruling party's core electorate, and is more about packaging the government's reforms attractively than abandoning its its radical state re-construction programme

text_rank summary: Indeed, some commentators have suggested that the reshuffle may be part of a more ambitious, long-term project of transforming Law and Justice into a pragmatic conservative grouping; although others dismiss it as simply a tactical pivot similar to the one that the party performed so successfully in the run-up to the 2015 elections.Beata Szydło’s administration took the political flak for introducing these reforms but, with the passage of the judicial reform laws at the end of last year, many of the key elements of the government’s state re-construction programme are now in place.

Political stabilisation and improving EU relations One of the reshuffle’s main objectives was to stabilise and consolidate Law and Justice’s position ahead of a series of key elections: local government elections in autumn 2018, European Parliament elections in summer 2019, and parliamentary elections in autumn 2019, culminating in the summer 2020 presidential poll.

Title: What the 2015 Greek debt negotiations tell us about Germany's negotiating stance on Brexit
Word count: 1401
Abstract: If the UK wants to secure favourable terms during the Brexit negotiations, it will be crucial to win the support of Germany. But what are the key German priorities as the talks move on to the second phase? Luuk Molthof writes that the 2015 Greek debt negotiations offer some insights into the German approach, and that the UK is likely to be disappointed if it believes Germany will put economic interests above its political support for European integration
basic similarity: 0.46739467262411993
basic summary: To understand why the British government would do well to heed these warnings, it is useful to be reminded of Germany’s role in the 2015 Greek bailout negotiations. The reason why Germany ultimately agreed to another bailout was because a Greek exit from the eurozone would undermine the euro’s credibility as an instrument of political integration. Yet in order to protect the euro’s role as a political instrument, Germany was willing to bear the economic costs.

Similarly, Germany is likely to be willing to bear the economic costs of a no deal Brexit should that be necessary to protect the integrity of the internal market.

The British government faces a similar suboptimal outcome should it fail to come to the realisation soon that it is indeed the junior negotiating partner, that time is really not on its side, and that empty threats to walk away from the negotiations without a deal aren’t likely to change anyone’s mind, least of all Germany’s.

text_rank similarity: 0.31522305146551355
text_rank summary: Assuming the VFL bill makes it beyond the second reading, we can expect any subsequent parliamentary debate to be highly politicised: opposition parties see VFL not as a progressive move to end the disenfranchisement of potentially millions of its citizens living outside the UK, but as a cynical ploy to increase Tory votes and donations (individuals can only donate if they are on an electoral register).This is further corroborated by the simultaneous statement from the Chair of ‘Conservatives Abroad’, Heather Harper, who welcomed the government’s renewed commitment to VFL: “The second reading of [the Overseas Electors Bill] brings us closer to getting votes for life for all British expatriates”.Certain campaigners have suggested that the creation of dedicated ‘overseas’ constituencies, such as those created by France, Italy, and Portugal, would avoid the problems of establishing proof of previous registration or residence, and would give expats better representation.

Title: Quantity does matter as citation impact increases with productivity
Word count: 1040
Abstract: Many scholars are encouraged to focus on the quality not the quantity of their publications, the rationale being that becoming too focused on productivity risks reducing the quality of one's work. But is this, in fact, the case? Peter van den Besselaar and Ulf Sandström have studied a large sample of researchers and found that, while results vary by field, there is a positive and stronger than linear relationship between productivity and quality (in terms of the top cited papers). This same pattern appears to apply to institutions as well as individual researchers

In the social sciences, the (slightly) “diminishing returns” pattern seems to dominate; whereas the “impact ceiling” pattern was found for computer science & mathematics and for the humanities. Higher numbers of papers do result in even higher numbers of top cited papers.

sim_matrix summary: Figure 1 shows the various possible relationships between “quality” and “quantity” that may exist: (i) there may be an “impact ceiling”, meaning that after a certain number of papers the number of highly cited papers stabilises; there could be (ii) diminishing; (iii) constant; or even (iv) increasing “impact returns” from productivity; and finally (v) “small may be beautiful” in the sense that the number of high-impact papers decreases when authors become too productive, trading quality for quantity. Our understanding, developed in a recent PLoS ONE paper, is that there is a positive and stronger than linear relationship between productivity and quality (in terms of the top cited papers). We tested this using the Leiden Ranking 2014, which details the number of papers and the number of papers belonging to the top 10% highly cited papers for all universities included. This size effect also holds at organisational level, something we did not address in the PLoS ONE paper but tested after a reviewer claimed the opposite: “the CWTS Leiden Ranking, for example, does not show such a linear relationship as the authors claim between the number of papers produced by a university and the percentage of highly cited papers produced by that university”.

Title: Far right politics in Germany: from fascism to populism?
Word count: 1533
Abstract: The rise of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) was one of the major stories of the 2017 German elections. As Tomá\v Nociar and Jan Philipp Thomeczek write, there has been a tendency among some commentators to draw parallels between the AfD and extremist or fascist parties from Germany's past. They argue that this is both unhelpful and inaccurate, and that the AfD has far more in common with other ‘populist’ parties who have had success in recent European elections
basic similarity: 0.3153863617359825
basic summary: This new type of populist radical right party either never developed or dropped the antidemocratic sentiment in favour of a populist critique of the establishment. It is the rise of a populist radical right that is successful precisely because of its populism and not because it embodies fascism or extremism. There is a current, often criticised trend to use the term populism to describe contemporary far right politics.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.4789994534256334
sim_matrix summary: The case of Germany: Why the AfD succeeds where the NPD failed The difference between the traditional extreme right and the contemporary populist radical right can best be exemplified when looking at the history and ideology of two far right parties in Germany: the National Democratic Party (NPD), founded in 1964, and the Alternative for Germany (AfD), founded in 2013. It is the rise of a populist radical right that is successful precisely because of its populism and not because it embodies fascism or extremism. Several authors point out that it is precisely populism that distinguishes the traditional post-war antidemocratic extreme right, which was inspired by interwar fascist movements, from the modern populist far right parties.

Regarding international cooperation, the NPD allies itself with other extremist parties and is a member of the Alliance for Peace and Freedom along with parties such as Greece’s Golden Dawn or Kotleba – People’s Party Our Slovakia, the only two truly extreme right parties with seats in national parliaments of EU member states. In the following period, the emphasis on national/nationalist discourse (“Germany”, “Germans”, “Volk”) became stronger.

Title: LSE festival Beveridge 2.0 preview: 'why we need a citizen's basic income: a new edition or a new book?' by Malcolm Torry
Word count: 1430
Abstract: On Tuesday 20 February 2018, LSE hosted a ‘Citizen’s Basic Income Day’, including the LSE Festival evening event, ‘Beveridge Rebooted: A Basic Income for Every Citizen?’: listen to the podcast here. Ahead of the discussion, panellist Dr Malcolm Torry discusses his forthcoming new book on the topic, Why We Need a Citizen’s Basic Income, and how it builds on his previous works, including Money for Everyone: Why We Need a Citizen’s Income
basic similarity: 0.19469162526389894
basic summary: Everyone of the same age would receive the same amount, every week or every month, no matter what their income, wealth, employment status, household structure, etc. We decided to put detailed research results in an online appendix because we believed that the figures would go out of date much faster than the book.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.4298109532849054
sim_matrix summary: A Citizen’s Basic Income (sometimes called a Basic Income, a Citizen’s Income or a Universal Basic Income) is an unconditional and nonwithdrawable income for every individual. The final two chapters were about alternatives to Citizen’s Basic Income, and about the social problems that a Citizen’s Basic Income would not solve.
text_rank similarity: 0.3417048634897042
text_rank summary: A brief flurry of activity 35 years ago prompted a small group of us to form the Basic Income Research Group – now the Citizen’s Basic Income Trust – and then the Basic Income European Network (BIEN: now the Basic Income Earth Network) to promote research and debate, so that the idea wouldn’t disappear entirely, and so that the next time there was an upswing in interest, there would be expertise and literature available to facilitate an intelligent discussion.By 2016 the question ‘would a Citizen’s Basic Income be a good idea?’ was still being asked, but two other questions were if anything more prominent: would a Citizen’s Basic Income be feasible?
tfidf similarity: 0.391071107287548
tfidf summary: In the evening, Professors Philippe Van Parijs and John Kay will debate the motion: ‘This house believes that if the Beveridge Report were being written today then it would have recommended a Basic Income’. A Citizen’s Basic Income (sometimes called a Basic Income, a Citizen’s Income or a Universal Basic Income) is an unconditional and nonwithdrawable income for every individual.

The answer to that question might, of course, be different from the answer to the question: ‘do we need a Citizen’s Basic Income?’ Dr. Malcolm Torry has been Director of the Citizen’s Basic Income Trust since 2001 (and was Director before that between 1988 and 1992); he is a Visiting Senior Fellow in the Social Policy Department at LSE; and he is General Manager of BIEN, The Basic Income Earth Network.

Title: Who is helped by Help to Buy?
Word count: 1831
Abstract: What's not to like about a policy which can expand home ownership and boost the supply of housing? Geoff Meeks and J.Gay Meeks recount some of the doubts about the efficacy of the government's Help to Buy scheme. They present new evidence on some of its regressive distributional consequences, and touch on the opportunity cost of the subsidy programme
basic similarity: 0.407356173557794
basic summary: These are “equity loans”, which means the government’s stake in a participating house changes at the same rate with the value of the house. As house prices rise, the argument goes, the government achieves capital gains, which offset the interest costs of servicing the debt which funds H2B. So the new house will be much the better buy, and it will be worth her while to pay more for the new than for the second- hand house.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.42080610435706217
sim_matrix summary: One consequence of the H2B subsidy further stoking the inflation of house prices is that the initial aim of the scheme is subverted: renters who can’t take advantage of the H2B subsidy are left further behind. Table 1 shows the total H2B loans extended by the government nationally in each year since 2013; and the builders’ average profit margin and return on equity for two years before and each year after H2B began. As it is only available for new homes, a Londoner faced with the choice between a new house costing £550k and an identical second-hand house at the same price can get an H2B subsidy of around £7k a year (the interest saved) if she opts for the new house.
text_rank similarity: 0.39348369546530537
text_rank summary: But similarly, if house prices fall, then the Exchequer will be faced not just with the interest bill but also with a capital loss impairing the public sector balance sheet: the total cost of H2B will be higher still.One report suggests that H2B has allowed builders to raise selling prices by towards 10%.So on top of the pressure from existing home-owners not to suffer falls in the value of their homes, and from house- builders anxious to keep the party going, H2B creates another political imperative to keep the bubble inflating – avoiding impairment of the government’s H2B loans.
tfidf similarity: 0.4485068566920345
tfidf summary: Another is that part of the benefit of the subsidy is appropriated by the builders. So the new house will be much the better buy, and it will be worth her while to pay more for the new than for the second- hand house. Again we have analysed the information provided by companies’ annual reports on executives’ incomes and gains before and after the introduction of H2B.

Title: El Salvador's experience of UN peacebuilding reveals the ineffectiveness of 'development as usual' approaches
Word count: 1156
Abstract: To provide the vital "peace dividend" of better lives and livelihoods, peacebuilding must promote conflict-sensitive policies even where they are economically second-best. The UN can support this process by helping states in transition to reactivate their economies in an inclusive and sustainable manner, writes Graciana del Castillo (City University of New York)

basic summary: And even those that achieved a tenuous peace ended up highly aid dependent, often even for basic food needs. Lacking support, former combatants had to abandon programmes like arms-for-land that had given them a stake, however small, in the peace process.

sim_matrix summary: With the country at the brink of war only nine months after the peace agreement of January 1992, El Salvador provided early evidence of many of obstacles to peacebuilding that would later plague transitions to peace elsewhere in the world. The path to peace dividends With El Salvador now considered by most accounts a failed state, the lesson for the UN, as well as for Colombia and other countries undergoing transitions to peace, is that economic reconstruction of war-torn societies is not “development as usual”.

Title: The hidden costs of research assessment exercises: the curious case of Australia
Word count: 1309
Abstract: Research assessment exercises provide the government and wider public with assurance of the quality of university research, with the guiding principles being accountability, transparency, and openness. But is there the same accountability and openness when it comes to the public cost of these large-scale exercises? Ksenia Sawczak examines the situation in Australia as the research sector looks ahead to the new Engagement and Impact Assessment later this year. There seems little doubt this exercise will demand significant resources, with no guarantee it will achieve its stated goal of improving how universities engage with industry. Until the hidden costs of assessment exercises are revealed and a thorough consideration of their general utility is undertaken, questions will remain as to whether they are a responsible use of public monies

basic summary: There seems little doubt this exercise will demand significant resources, with no guarantee it will achieve its stated goal of improving how universities engage with industry. What is curious about Australia is that ERA functions in a vacuum, conducted by government but playing no role in informing federal research policy or funding allocations to universities. The authors of the NISA boldly stated that an exercise of this kind will ultimately lead to improvements in how universities engage with industry. Ksenia Sawczak examines the situation in Australia as the research sector looks ahead to the new Engagement and Impact Assessment later this year. About the author Ksenia Sawczak is Director of Research Services at the University of Canberra, where she oversees the preparation of data submissions to government agencies.

sim_matrix summary: But for an exercise so firmly grounded in principles of accountability, transparency, and openness with the public – something particularly evident in prefaces to the National Reports the ARC releases after each ERA, which strongly emphasise the importance of assuring the public of the value of government investment in research – the missing element is the public cost of such an endeavour. To further complicate matters, the ARC has decided to follow in the footsteps of the UK’s Research Evaluation Framework by conducting a new assessment exercise this year – the Engagement and Impact Assessment. Across Australia, universities are in the throes of pulling together submissions to Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA) – the comprehensive assessment exercise, overseen by the Australian Research Council (ARC), which serves as a stocktake of all research conducted in Australian universities. For some time, the Australian government has been strongly concerned about the benefits of university-generated research beyond academia, leading to this new assessment exercise being announced as part of its 2015 National Innovation and Science Agenda. Until the hidden costs of assessment exercises in Australia are revealed and a thorough consideration of their general utility is undertaken, they will remain an international curiosity, with the dubious honour of serving as an example of assessment for the sake of assessment and irresponsible use of public monies.

Everyone knows them, and they are also the tool most Australian universities now use to set targets for performance and monitor their own achievements. 2018 marks the fourth running of this gigantic exercise since its introduction in 2010, and the high frequency of the exercise means universities are now well-accustomed to the never-ending cycle of submissions, with preparations for a new round commencing as soon as the previous one ends.

Apart from ERA, Australian universities undertake a multitude of other regular reporting to government in research-related areas, such as the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ Survey of Research and Experimental Development and the Department of Innovation’s National Survey of Research Commercialisation, although the submission data is not subject to evaluation.

Title: Looming REF deadlines lead to a rush in publication of lower quality research
Word count: 1280
Abstract: The increased significance of research assessments and their implications for funding and career prospects has had a knock-on effect on academic publication patterns. Moqi Groen-Xu, Pedro A. Teixeira, Thomas Voigt and Bernhard Knapp report on research that reveals a marked increase in research productivity immediately prior to an evaluation deadline, which quickly reverses once the deadline has passed. Moreoever, the quality of papers published just before deadlines is lower, as measured by citations. Those who design research assessments should consider having cycles of varying lengths across different fields, affording researchers the time and opportunity to pursue more novel, risky projects

basic summary: Our research indicates that research output does indeed change around the time researchers are submitted to assessment exercises. Those who design research assessments should consider having cycles of varying lengths across different fields, affording researchers the time and opportunity to pursue more novel, risky projects. After our research was reported on the Times Higher Education, Steven Hill – Head of Research Policy at HEFCE – raised concerns about our interpretation of the findings. Because older papers had more time to accumulate citations, information about them is more precise at that time, thus biasing the choice of older articles with higher citation counts.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.38216974100200446
sim_matrix summary: The variance in journal impact factor is higher for papers published just after the deadline, indicating that researchers did not just time their publications accordingly but possibly also pursued more novel and uncertain research projects when further from the deadline. Our research indicates that research output does indeed change around the time researchers are submitted to assessment exercises. This should allow departments with longer research cycles to pursue a more important research agenda. However, we actually observe a higher variance of quality in research published further from the deadline.

Title: EU Withdrawal Agreement: the real losers will be British businesses and British citizens

Abstract: When Britain leaves the EU in March 2019, will it become isolated and not influential, to paraphrase Sir John Major's words from his speech last week? In this blog, Monica Horten (LSE) investigates the Transition chapter of the EU Withdrawal Agreement and scrutinises how far Britain's influence could be written out from the very start

Title: The UK government is shedding some of its illusions about Brexit, and softening its position
Word count: 1040
Abstract: Step by step, the UK government is shedding some of its illusions about Brexit, argues Holger Schmieding (Berenberg). The United Kingdom has already accepted that it will have to meet the legally binding financial commitments it incurred while it was a member of the European Union (the so-called Brexit bill) and is going along with the EU's timetable for negotiations (divorce issues first, transition deal next, outlines of a future trade deal last). Last Friday saw another set of concessions being made by the Prime Minister
basic similarity: 0.29300883254900806
basic summary: Under such a deal, the UK would maintain access to the EU’s single market for goods and for some services on almost the same preferential terms as before. The only practical way in which Brexit could be reversed would be if early new elections swept a Labour-led government to power that might possibly call a new referendum. However, Theresa May is not yet close to such a deal that would minimise the economic damage to the UK.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.4964065301226049
sim_matrix summary: The only way to draw hope from the Mansion House speech is to view it as just one of many steps on the long road from British Brexit illusions to an acceptance of reality: the UK government can either insist on its positions and suffer a hard Brexit without a significant deal with the EU or accept the terms for a preferential market access agreement that the EU can offer – or possibly reconsider Brexit once it has become fully clear what Brexit will entail in practice. If Theresa May continues to ditch one illusion after the other, making the UK position progressively more realistic without shattering her fractious government in the process, the UK may still end up with the semi-soft or soft Brexit that minimises the economic damage for the UK. As a result, any deal will reflect the bargaining position of the EU much more than the wishes of the UK government.

Third, as Ireland is the EU27 country most affected by Brexit, the EU has de facto granted Ireland a veto over the terms of any deal on post-Brexit relations which the EU27 can strike with the UK. On the most fundamental level, May does not yet seem to acknowledge three key facts: First, the medium-sized UK earns 12 per cent of its GDP through exports to the EU27 whereas the EU27 send exports worth merely 3 per cent of their GDP to the UK.

In her speech at Mansion House last Friday, Prime Minister Theresa May went one step further, acknowledging that the UK has to face “hard facts” on Brexit and that “life is going to be different after Brexit”. If we extrapolate the British learning curve into the future, reason may still prevail in the end with an agreement on a “soft” or “semi-soft” Brexit by October 2018, in time for both sides to ratify it before the UK formally leaves the EU on 29 March 2019.

A new partnership body, Productivity UK, should also be established with the goal of raising firm-level productivity, including the acceleration of investment in automation technologies. Whereas past waves of automation typically required machines to have a clear set of instructions in structured environments to enable them to perform tasks once done by humans, today’s machines can act without explicit instruction in complex environments.

Kate Botterill (Edinburgh Napier University) discusses how the result and subsequent uncertainty affected them, and the strategies they have adopted to deal with it. Post-Brexit, the Scottish Government want a different approach to migration from the rest of the UK, which may lead to stronger identification with Scotland among many Poles living in the country. Nonetheless, Scottish public attitudes towards migration appear to be hardening

Given these challenges, will changing Scotland’s narrative on migration be enough to make EU citizens feel at home? This research raises key questions about how Polish nationals are negotiating belonging in Scotland through broader affiliations with Europe, and often away from Poland. When it comes to migration, Scotland is widely considered to be on a different political journey to the rest of the UK.

Title: The crisis in social care is connected to the gendered inadequacy of labour law
Word count: 1218
Abstract: Lydia Hayes writes that social care is a feminist issue. Highlighting some of the appalling conditions that care workers tolerate, she explains how employment law fails to protect women's employment and to value feminised labour. She concludes that unless social care provision is revolutionised, women will have little choice but to serve as unpaid carers: stuck at home, excluded from public life, and denied life choices

Care workers are failed by the current right to a minimum wage where their work is not recognised as ‘work’ for the purposes of statutory pay protection.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.33128680985286757
sim_matrix summary: When the social care minimum wage scandal of 2017 highlighted that thousands of care workers were paid nothing more than pocket-money to ensure the overnight well-being of vulnerable adults, employers were outraged that they should have to pay care workers what was legally owed. Until the wages of care workers are free from sexist devaluation, and until the work of care workers is fully recognised, the labour of all women is devalued. If we continue to tolerate care workers being employed to work without pay, the future of care work will be based on sexist expectations that care work should be done for free.

text_rank summary: Although the right to a minimum wage was supposed to prevent exploitation, it has become standard industry practice for care workers to work for free during increasingly large parts of each working day.A sex- based ideology about women’s subservience to the needs of others still circulates in the contemporary labour market, and minimum wage law does not do enough to assert the value of care work.If we continue to tolerate care workers being employed to work without pay, the future of care work will be based on sexist expectations that care work should be done for free.

frequency summary: Inadequacies in equal pay law perpetuate the historic subordination of women in low-waged work, prevent care workers from achieving economic independence, and exemplify the economic invisibility of skills and abilities which are thought to arise ‘naturally’ in women. Care workers are failed by the current right to a minimum wage where their work is not recognised as ‘work’ for the purposes of statutory pay protection. Where women do not work in close proximity to men, equal pay law offers very little and prevents women from comparing their wages to those of men who do not work for the same employer.

Title: High prices, not waste or over-use, drive high health care costs in the US
Word count: 881
Abstract: The US spends nearly 18 percent of its GDP on health care, making it a real outlier among high-income countries in this area. But what is behind this unusually high level of health care spending? Irene Papanicolas investigates common beliefs about why spending is so high, including that US residents use more health care services, have poorer quality of care, and use 'too much' inpatient care. She finds that higher costs in the US are largely driven by higher prices across a wide range of health care services such as surgical procedures and drugs, as well as administrative complexity and costs
basic similarity: 0.5571066253885557
basic summary: The data suggest two main factors drive health care spending in the US: higher prices across a wide range of health care services and administrative complexity and costs. Evidence: The US has among the lowest proportion of health care spending on inpatient services (19 percent) and among the highest for outpatient services (42 percent). While low social spending may contribute to poorer population health outcomes, it is unlikely a primary driver of higher health care spending. Belief 1: The US spends more than other countries because US residents consume much more health care services.

Title: How we can preserve assisted housing in the context of gentrification and constrained federal resources
Word count: 1239
Abstract: Like many American cities, Washington DC is experiencing a squeeze in its affordable housing: population increases and declining stocks of government subsidized housing are making it harder for low-income households to find somewhere to live. In new research, Kathryn Howell looks at how existing assisted housing in Washington, DC is being preserved in the face of gentrification and funding challenges. She writes that preservation is a long and complex process that engages diverse stakeholders from tenants and tenant organizers to local and federal agency staff
basic similarity: 0.4912927530547169
basic summary: This case offers powerful support for increased collaboration between stakeholders and meaningful local laws and flexible funding for the preservation of affordable housing. But developing new funding sources and programs for the complex process of preservation requires multiple private and government stakeholders, shared governance and access to data. She writes that preservation is a long and complex process that engages diverse stakeholders from tenants and tenant organizers to local and federal agency staff.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.4140020542281627
sim_matrix summary: The DC Preservation Network is a monthly meeting of preservation stakeholders from tenant organizers to federal government staff. These stakeholders used a mix local policies, including local tenant protections, flexible funding sources such as DC’s Housing Production Trust Fund, and laws that enabled access to the housing market such as the Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act, which gives tenants the right of first refusal when their building is for sale. One example of the process for preservation and loss is Museum Square Apartments in Washington, DC.
text_rank similarity: 0.367286731061832
text_rank summary: Federal resources have declined for 40 years in the United States, leaving many cities and states, regardless of the market, at a loss to support the development and preservation of affordable housing.However, the Museum Square One case is just one example of the way affordable housing leaves the subsidized stock, as well as the efforts made by a broad group of stakeholders to try to preserve it.Many cities – like the District of Columbia – have begun to understand that production of units using federal funds only approaches a portion of the problem in the face of the growth in many US cities that has made neighbourhoods unaffordable for low- and moderate-income households.

Because of the diverse scale impacts of affordable housing – city, neighbourhood, building and tenant – as well as the dimensions of funding, code enforcement and daily living, there must be an avenue through which data can be shared to create a more complete picture of the building’s status.

Title: Critical actors and abortion law: a group of individuals in Northern Irish politics obstructs change
Word count: 965
Abstract: There are various reasons why progress on legal abortion in Northern Ireland has been blocked over the years. Key among them is that individual politicians rule out any suggestion of change, writes Jennifer Thomson. She argues that more attention should be given to the actions of individual actors, considering their role can often be as important as that of political parties or institutions
basic similarity: 0.3653035509601473
basic summary: Feminist political scientists have long employed the concept of ‘critical actors’ to refer to key individuals who instigate positive change within political institutions. Attempts to change abortion policy at the moment are also not helped by the fact that Northern Ireland is facing one of its most challenging political periods in decades. When considering why some policies are difficult to change, or even to implement at all, consideration must be given to the actions of individual members of political institutions.

Attempts to change abortion policy at the moment are also not helped by the fact that Northern Ireland is facing one of its most challenging political periods in decades.

This has been the case in Northern Ireland, where a small number of critical actors have obstructed change on abortion for many years. In 2013, Paul Girvan DUP MLA and Alban Maginness SDLP MLA attempted to outlaw any private abortion providers in Northern Ireland which would have closed down the newly opened Marie Stopes clinic in central Belfast.

Word count: 1257
Abstract: Following on from his previous analysis on why city centrism has not turned out to be a panacea for urban development so far, Andy Pike argues it is time for fresh thinking. He explains why we need to find better ways to think about and design policies that support the combination of the dynamism of Britain's city centres

Title: In Congressional races, political networks play an important role in ensuring minority representation
Word count: 1198
Abstract: A number of retirements in Congress ahead of the 2018 midterms have opened up the possibility for increased Latino representation in the US House of Representatives. But, the past has shown that Latino candidates aren't always selected for, or win elections in, majority Latino districts and that Latinos and non-Latinos who are elected don't always represent the views of their constituents. In new research, Angela X. Ocampo finds that political networks have a large influence on whether a Latino or non-Latino gets onto the ballot as a candidate. These networks are also often able to push candidates forward based on their legislative priorities, which may or may not align with the preferences of their constituents
basic similarity: 0.527161883329931
basic summary: This article is based on the paper The Wielding Influence of Political Networks: Representation in Majority- Latino Districts in Political Research Quarterly (PRQ). Lastly, the evidence showed that lack of coordination and fragmentation among existent political networks paved the way for the emergence of non-Latino candidates in majority-Latino districts. Political networks were also critical in narrowing down candidate fields when announced Latino and non-Latino candidates might weaken the chances of one another. The dataset included vote turns, candidate and district demographics and financial contributions made by the candidates themselves, individuals, parties and groups.

sim_matrix summary: Political networks were also critical in narrowing down candidate fields when announced Latino and non-Latino candidates might weaken the chances of one another. I investigated the activities of political networks in majority-Latino districts to understand why some districts are able to elect Latino representatives and some are not. I also compiled a dataset of the Latino and non-Latino candidates running in all open-seat congressional races from 2004 to 2014 that had a Latino population plurality. All of this suggests that political networks matter a great deal in shaping Latino descriptive and substantive representation.

text_rank summary: Political networks were also critical in narrowing down candidate fields when announced Latino and non-Latino candidates might weaken the chances of one another.For example, the evidence from Arizona’s 7th congressional district clearly showed that the candidates who were running in this district were supported by very different factions of the Democratic Party with distinct policy agendas.The dataset included vote turns, candidate and district demographics and financial contributions made by the candidates themselves, individuals, parties and groups.Obtained through a simulation from one of my models, Figure 1 below shows the predicted probability of a Latino candidate winning in a majority- Latino open-seat as a function of contributions from committees and parties, versus individual-level contributions, while holding all other candidate and district level variables constant.
tfidf similarity: 0.5602905813046116

basic summary: Ben Margulies writes that the treatment of these students echoes the way whites treat non-white political opponents: often as ‘enemies’ or ‘aliens’ who are unworthy of civil discourse.

sim_matrix similarity: 0.3262029488710288
sim_matrix summary: What is new – at least among white American students – is the wave of gun-control activism that has swept American schools, including Douglas itself. To put it another way, in moments of extreme polarization, each political camp may start treating its opponents as enemy combatants, rather than fellow citizens, and in the United States, such treatment is likely to echo – however distantly – the way whites treat non-white political opponents.

Title: EU students at UK universities: patterns and trends
Word count: 624
Abstract: What Brexit will mean for UK universities varies from institution to institution. Much data on Brexit's impact focuses on sector-wide aggregates, the forest that hides the trees. The UK provides excellent teaching and research, as illustrated by the number of its universities ranked in the top 10, 50 or 100 in the world. Yet despite its world-class reputation, the UK's higher education sector is hierarchical, and various layers will be affected differently. Ludovic Highman (UCL) explores the sector’s diversity in this regard
basic similarity: 0.35516927936380516
basic summary: Currently they are treated as home students, but in all likelihood EU students enrolling in the UK after its withdrawal in March 2019 will be treated as overseas students. The diversity of the student fabric of UK universities, so crucial to the overall student experience, depends on a healthy number of non-UK based students interacting with domestic students. Scottish universities are attractive to non-UK EU students in absolute numbers, with Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen attracting more than Oxbridge and competing with the top London universities. EU students graduate from rigorous secondary school systems and their drive to study abroad, most often in a language that is not theirs, makes them attractive to UK universities. It is possible that higher concentrations of EU students will further relocate to Scotland, though this depends on the level of fees charged beyond 2020.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.3906230148169304
sim_matrix summary: Under the current tuition fee system, Scottish universities will remain attractive to prospective EU students, while many of their English counterparts (outside London and Oxbridge) that already have lower proportions of EU students will be less attractive if non-UK EU students lose their current status, comparatively-speaking. The tuition fee regime seems to have an impact on the choice of destination, as suggested by the high numbers and ratios of EU students in Scottish universities, while London as a global city attracts the most EU students.

Title: Book review: how to be a geek: essays on the culture of software by Matthew Fuller
Word count: 1358
Abstract: In How to be a Geek: Essays on the Culture of Software, Matthew Fuller explores the bits and bytes that have reshaped our world through a collection of essays that examines the figure of the geek and software cultures. While the lack of cohesive thread and use of terminology means this collection is best suited to scholars already familiar with the field rather than newcomers, the book contains some useful and astute insights, writes Wendy Liu
basic similarity: 0.3458043934321252
basic summary: Overall, How To Be a Geek is a useful addition to the field of software studies, geared primarily toward academics who are already enmeshed in the field. ‘Entities’, which contains three essays broadly touching on contemporary software culture, makes for smoother reading.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.4618761570962238
sim_matrix summary: Fuller himself is Professor of Cultural Studies at Goldsmiths University, and has published several other books on the subject of software studies, including Software Studies: A Lexicon (MIT Press, 2008) and Behind the Blip: Essays on the Culture of Software (Autonomedia, 2003). This is not a book for software developers looking for a critical perspective on software culture; How To Be a Geek is about the geek, not for the geek, and its goal is to shed some light on software culture for an academic audience, ideally one with some knowledge of social theorists like Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze.

text_rank summary: Those who are looking for a first-person account on the cultural aspects of software production should look elsewhere—Paul Graham’s Hackers & Painters or Ellen Ullman’s Close to the Machine come to mind—as Fuller’s approach is more about investigating the figure of the ‘geek’ through the lens of cultural studies, treating it as an intriguing specimen for academic analysis.There are some astute insights to be found as the book investigates software through the lens of cultural studies, though it will require some work on the part of the reader, as the prose blends terminology from both disciplines in a way that can be hard to follow.

Title: The more revisions a paper undergoes, the greater its subsequent recognition in terms of citations

Abstract: Is the peer review process simply a means by which errors are identified and corrected? Or is it a process in which a more constructive dialogue can take place and reviewers and editors may actively contribute to the text? John Rigby, Deborah Cox and Keith Julian have studied the published articles of a social sciences journal and found that the more revisions a paper undergoes, the greater its subsequent recognition in terms of citations

Title: It's not enough for research to be useful to policy actors, we must try to actually influence change
Word count: 1544
Abstract: There is no doubt that good communications and framing research and evidence for your audience is important to influencing policy and having research impact. But shouldn't we be aiming higher than producing and packaging research that simply meets the demands of policy actors? Surely what we actually want to do is influence change, not reinforce social and political norms? James Georgalakis argues that research and researchers need to challenge dominant paradigms and expose inconvenient truths. Relationships, networks, and bodies of knowledge play a far more significant role in change processes than short-term communications campaigns on specific research reports
basic similarity: 0.4660266580637651
basic summary: The first is the simple one favoured by research donors and think tanks that says that research, if packaged correctly, can directly “enlighten” policy actors. We try and overcome academics’ nervousness about policy engagement by demonstrating that research rigour and policy engagement can be mutually reinforcing. However, another model describes how by trying to shape research and evidence for policy we may actually allow politics to shape knowledge. Academics’ anxiety over engaging in policy, which can sometimes seem very inconvenient, centres less on the issue of measurement and more on the fundamental relationship between evidence and policy. The semi-professional disciplines of both policy influence and research impact always attract the communications crowd.

It’s not enough for research to be useful to policy actors, we must try to actually influence change There is no doubt that good communications and framing research and evidence for your audience is important to influencing policy and having research impact. As I explored in the Social Realities of Knowledge for Development, the interaction between research and policy is deeply social and the most appropriate means of measuring your institution’s impact probably relates to changes in relationships, not column inches, tweets, or policy citations. Bodies of knowledge and relationships Relationships, networks, and bodies of knowledge play a far more significant role in change processes than short- term communications campaigns on specific reports. I am reminded of Andy Sumner’s work on the New Bottom Billion back in 2010 when IDS challenged the dominant view that development must be about tackling extreme poverty in the poorest countries.

Title: We need more carrots: give academic researchers the support and incentives to share data
Word count: 1120
Abstract: Making data available for other researchers to find, use, reuse, and reproduce is fundamental to open science, and ultimately makes research more efficient and effective. Yet despite funder policies that encourage and require data sharing, researchers in both the UK and the US report lower percentages of data sharing than the global average. In addition to progressive policies, Grace Baynes suggests researchers should be given incentives, expert support, training, and the infrastructure to make it seamless and easy to share data, and worth their while. Governments, funders, research institutions, libraries, and publishers all have a role to play to unlock the huge potential of research data

basic summary: Yet despite funder policies that encourage and require data sharing, researchers in both the UK and the US report lower percentages of data sharing than the global average. Our findings, Practical Challenges for Researchers in Data Sharing, are openly accessible in Figshare along with the survey data.

frequency summary: Members of the newly formed UK Research and Innovation, an independent organisation that brings together the seven Research Councils, Innovate UK and Research England, the Wellcome Trust, and other UK funders have moved early to encourage and require data sharing. The issue for researchers may not be purely “lack of time” but “is it worth my time?” Published, citable datasets need to be viewed as research outputs on a par with a research article in terms of career advancement and assessment. For example, at Springer Nature we offer a free Research Data Support Helpdesk and recommended repositories list, as well as an optional Research Data Support service to help researchers and institutions deposit their data in repositories and make it easier to find and use. To achieve real “open science” we need to open up all areas of research, including research data.

Title: The neurotic academic: how anxiety fuels casualised academic work
Word count: 1380
Abstract: As higher education undergoes a process of marketisation in the UK and the activities of academic staff are increasingly measured and scrutinised, universities are suffused with anxiety. Coupled with pressures facing all staff, casualised academics face multiple forms of insecurity. While anxiety is often perceived as an individual problem for which employees are encouraged to take personal responsibility, Vik Loveday argues that anxiety amongst academic staff should be understood in two ways: as a symptom of casualised work in an increasingly competitive environment; and as a tactic of governance, ensuring compliance
basic similarity: 0.42852256777736447
basic summary: This blog post is based on the author’s article, “The neurotic academic: anxiety, casualisation, and governance in the neoliberalising university”, published in the Journal of Cultural Economy (DOI: 10.1080/17530350.2018.1426032). Anxiety, then, can be conceptualised as a kind of “tactic” of governance: fuelling hard work, a striving for so-called “excellence”, and the creation of obedient academic subjects. It will come as no surprise to those working in the UK’s higher education (HE) sector that universities are currently suffused with anxiety.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.4277521662824275
sim_matrix summary: Anxiety was one of the defining themes to emerge from the interviews, and – most obviously – the pervasiveness of anxiety appeared to be a kind of symptom of casualised employment within the increasingly competitive landscape of the neoliberalising sector. For those participants who had been working on multiple contracts for extended periods of time, fixed-term work had led to feelings of marginalisation and stress in the workplace and – in some serious cases – mental ill-health. In addition to pressures facing many staff in universities – such as time- management, meeting growing employer expectations, and the evaluation of performance – “casualised” contracts present particular challenges for those facing employment uncertainty: in a material sense, this can be a case of keeping up with regular payments for rent and bills, or providing for dependents; on a day-to-day basis, time is spent juggling existing contracts with job applications and interviews, whilst acknowledging that planning for the future often seems unthinkable – even farcical – in the face of the unknown.
text_rank similarity: 0.4231945097692811
text_rank summary: Far from providing convenient flexibility, the participants in my research felt as though they had very little control over their working lives apart from the possibility of “working on the self” – taking personal responsibility for productivity, success, and “excellence” through the pursuit of student satisfaction, publications, or external funding, which was often achieved through chronic over-work fuelled by anxiety, but with no financial security or guarantee of permanent work at the end of contracts.While anxiety is quite clearly an effect of the conditions under which it is produced, during the project I began to turn my attention to what anxiety itself might be achieving: in the first instance, anxiety can be seen as a symptom of precarious work, which affected the participants on an individual basis; yet their narratives also pointed to the more active role that anxiety played in the quest to find work and the forging of an “entrepreneurial academic self” appropriate to the demands of an increasingly competitive sector.The “privatisation of stress” involves a shift from examining the wider conditions under which we labour to a focus on the self, and the stressed-out figure of the casualised “neurotic academic” points not only to the personal but also the political costs of failing to resist processes that are detrimental to the health of staff and the wellbeing of the public university.

Title: PhD students supervised collectively rather than individually are quicker to complete their theses
Word count: 1366
Abstract: Given the choice, most PhD students would prefer to receive individual supervision rather than be supervised alongside their peers as part of a collective. This is understandable, given the undivided attention and precise, directly relevant advice one would receive. However, Hans Agné and Ulf Mörkenstam have compared the experiences of individually and collectively supervised students on the same doctoral programme and found that collective supervision, during the first year at least, is correlated with significantly shorter times to thesis completion compared to individual supervision
basic similarity: 0.4428941621617673
basic summary: Studied in this way, it appears that collective supervision of first-year doctoral students is correlated with significantly shorter times to thesis completion compared to individual supervision. Students who received collective supervision in the first year averaged 57 months in the programme, while students receiving individual supervision averaged 92 months. Multivariate statistical analyses of these observations support the conclusion that collective supervision in the first year does indeed reduce the time to completion of doctoral students.

sim_matrix summary: When it comes to assisting doctoral students to complete their theses on time or even as quickly as possible, this research has led us to believe that collective supervision in the first year of study significantly out-performs individual supervision. Studied in this way, it appears that collective supervision of first-year doctoral students is correlated with significantly shorter times to thesis completion compared to individual supervision. For example, it is well-known that time to doctoral completion depends on funding opportunities, the academic discipline, and the integration of doctoral students into ongoing research projects.

text_rank summary: When it comes to assisting doctoral students to complete their theses on time or even as quickly as possible, this research has led us to believe that collective supervision in the first year of study significantly out-performs individual supervision.We believe, therefore, that collective supervision, at least in the first year of doctoral studies, is superior to individual supervision, when it comes to reducing time to completion, and potentially also for other, higher aims in doctoral research, (e.g.So, in contexts where most doctoral theses are completed within time limits, the right focus of policy discussions may well be to encourage doctoral students to select more risky, creative, and demanding research problems rather than to shorten time to completion.

tfidf summary: Individual and collective supervision is one of several critical but as yet untested distinctions.

Title: Book review: deconstructing Dirty Dancing by Stephen Lee Naish
Word count: 1300
Abstract: In Deconstructing Dirty Dancing, Stephen Lee Naish unpacks the enduring popularity of the film Dirty Dancing, released to mixed reviews in 1987 before going on to become a global hit. Offering a comparative study of the film with David Lynch’s Blue Velvet before a scene-by-scene analysis and reflections on the film’s personal resonance for the author, the book is an idiosyncratic and accessible take on this cultural phenomenon, finds Penny Montague

basic summary: The essay is an absorbing account of his uneven relationship with the film, which will resonate with a wide range of readers, whether fans of the film or otherwise. Throughout this section of the book, Naish analyses and illuminates each moment of the film, its dialogue, music, wardrobe, plot and themes, particularly drawing out its political threads.

Title: Svexit or Huxit? How another country could follow the UK out of the EU
Word count: 1656
Abstract: What are the chances of another country following the UK out of the EU? Eurosceptics in other states may be emboldened by the deal the UK manages to secure, especially if it includes access to the Single Market. Moves to further EU integration could have a similar effect. Simon Hix (LSE) and Nick Sitter (Central European University) look at the cases of Hungary and Sweden
basic similarity: 0.3837329547673884
basic summary: A scenario that would see Sweden as the next country to leave the EU would have to involve a substantial change in the cross-party political consensus on European integration. The most realistic basis for such a scenario would involve the emergence of a model of European integration that is more attractive for Sweden than full EU membership. Should Brexit lead to a new model that is more attractive than the EEA, the benefits of EU membership might seem less obvious. Second, a successful soft Brexit could conceivably provide an attractive alternative to full EU membership.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.4411745639143173
sim_matrix summary: If Hungary loses EU subsidies, the benefits of EU membership (to the government) would be dramatically reduced. Having said that, support for the EU is volatile in both countries, and how Brexit plays out and how the EU responds internally to Brexit will influence the direction of travel for the publics and political parties in these two countries. Second, a successful soft Brexit could conceivably provide an attractive alternative to full EU membership. The most realistic basis for such a scenario would involve the emergence of a model of European integration that is more attractive for Sweden than full EU membership.

text_rank summary: A scenario that would see Sweden as the next country to leave the EU would have to involve a substantial change in the cross-party political consensus on European integration.A key difference between Britain and the next member state to leave is that the next exit is more likely to result from cold calculation of the costs and benefits of EU membership rather than a miscalculation by a prime minister and a country’s political establishment.A soft Brexit that leaves the UK with substantial access to the Single European Market, but does not cross Theresa May’s red lines in terms of budget contributions, free movement and the reach of the EU judiciary, might be the Conservative party’s dream for Britain.In the midst of the rather shambolic Brexit process, and with the growing recognition of the potentially huge economic costs of leaving the EU single market and customs union, it might seem an inopportune time to ask who will be next to leave the EU.

frequency similarity: 0.5712680296045533
frequency summary: Even a “hard Brexit”, along the lines of a Canada-style free trade agreement with zero tariffs and zero quotas on goods, could provide a model for trade in goods that protect German carmakers’ presence in Hungary, and thus could allow Hungary to exit the EU without undue damage to one of its main expert industries. This “British model” may start to become attractive to some current member states, who may assume they could avoid some of the costs the UK has gone through in the Brexit process, and jump straight to the final settlement deal for the UK. However painful Brexit may seem for the UK in the short- or medium-term, once the relationship between the UK and EU has been partially settled (it will of course be an ongoing settlement), there will be a new “off the shelf” association for others to consider: a “British model”, in addition to the existing Norwegian, Swiss, Canadian, Turkish, Ukrainian, and so on. A soft Brexit that leaves the UK with substantial access to the Single European Market, but does not cross Theresa May’s red lines in terms of budget contributions, free movement and the reach of the EU judiciary, might be the Conservative party’s dream for Britain.

Title: Book review: fire and fury: inside the Trump White House by Michael Wolff
Word count: 1440
Abstract: With the overnight international bestseller Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, Michael Wolff utilises his ‘semipermanent seat’ on a West Wing sofa to offer an insider account of the Trump administration. While critical of Wolff’s writing style, methods and failure to separate clear falsehoods from certainties, Jonny Hall concedes that the book remains a gripping read that is at its most revealing when discussing the warring factions shaping Trump’s Presidency
basic similarity: 0.31272529503148705
basic summary: In sum, I would contend that this book is slightly more accurate than is generally being portrayed, but Wolff’s methods and writing style hardly aid his cause. This is one of the grievances of what Wolff or Trump might call the ‘mainstream media’: that Wolff’s book is simply ‘gossip’, and that ‘gossip isn’t journalism’.

text_rank similarity: 0.3796175181050702
text_rank summary: There is something to be said for Drew Margary’s view that Wolff’s book was only possible because of his different aims, but the willingness ‘to toss decorum aside and burn bridges’ hardly speaks to the critique of the author’s failure to offer any visible validity-based reflections.The note also includes the following: Many of the accounts of what has happened in the Trump White House are in conflict with one another; many, in Trumpian fashion, are baldly untrue.
tfidf similarity: 0.36993753933105467
tfidf summary: The book has become an international bestseller overnight, helped no doubt by the now-traditional Twitter explosion from President Donald Trump alongside the White House’s attempts to prevent the book’s publication – a la the Spycatcher affair in Britain in the 1980s. Where Wolff’s book is helpful sounds simplistic, but it is that it puts all of Trump’s blemishes in one place.

This is why the most important parts of this book aren’t the gossip-styled accusations regarding Trump which have excited great furore – that he would ideally be in bed with a cheeseburger by 6:30pm or that he called current White House Communications Director Hope Hicks a ‘piece of tail’ – but the information on White House infighting, which is essentially Bannon’s insight, and on how specific policies were formed.

Word count: 1423
Abstract: Academia.edu has been called "Facebook for academics," and the analogy is fitting: Academia.edu mimics core social-media conventions, down to follower counts, curated profiles with pics, and a scrollable "News Feed" bulletin of followers’ uploads. But its reliance on user-facing metrics exceeds anything you’ll find on mainstream social media. It comes with a dedicated "Analytics" page resembling a gaming leaderboard or a corporation’s annual report. The charts and graphs encourage incessant monitoring, which dovetails with university policies that seek to measure quantifiable "impact." The result? Scholars are internalizing an analytics mind-set
basic similarity: 0.3342331147325014
basic summary: Scholars upload their paywalled papers, which become Google-indexed PDFs; the company uses these to draw in new members; the audience increases, prompting more scholars to upload their work. t most universities, annual evaluations and tenure decisions hinge on numbers: article counts, journal impact factors, h-index scores, and, perhaps, standardized teaching evaluations. This essay is based on an article, written with Brooke Erin Duffy, an assistant professor of communication at Cornell University, that recently appeared in Social Media + Society. With the audit culture lodged inside us, we don’t even need a warped incentive structure to overproduce papers and game the numbers. But now Academia.edu invites us to measure ourselves — to incorporate page views and download counts into our intellectual identities.

Title: Effects of the concentration of solids on the phenomenon of super-elevation in artificial curved open channels
Word count: 1594
Abstract: This present study analyses the effects of the concentration of solids in the over-elevation phenomenon in a canalwith a 180° curvature and a constant trapezoidal transversal section, with a firm bed, the fluid has a non-colloidal,mono-disperse distribution of relatively spherical particles of 1mm in size, thus making the rheology of the flow de-scribable by the Einstein-Roscoe equation (1). Two stages are proposed for the development of the research; the firstcorresponds to physical experimentation, achieved using an artificial canal, in which 420 tests were carried out usingdifferent concentration of solids and two slopes, in order to determine the behaviour of the bi-phased flow. All of thisis carried out by using experimental results and results obtained from numerical models. The data collected from theexperimental process is compared to the results obtained from the theoretical models that are reported in literature.An over-elevation equation was formulated from the analysis, which can be used for the bi-phased conditions de-scribed in this article. During the second phase, numerical modelling using the TITAN2F software was carried out,where laboratory conditions are replicated. Data found from numerical modelling is compared with experimentalresults, with the intention of validating the numerical model that TITAN2F uses. From what is mentioned above, itwas deduced that TITAN2F effectively reproduces the hydraulic phenomenon. However, it is also observed that theprogram has a low susceptibility to changes in the concentration of solids, due to the scale being use

Title: Extending Internet to Powerless Areas
Word count: 2820
Abstract: Literature ReviewThe lack of internet in undeveloped countries and other rural areas is detrimental to the development of the area. Access to internet can have many profound effects on developing countries such as creating economic opportunities for small and medium sized businesses (Meltzer) and improving education (Purdue). In many of these rural areas and developing countries, such as Africa, children do not have up to date education (The Economist), people struggle to find jobs (ACET), and the infrastructure is lacking (The World Bank). The lack of internet in areas that have been affected by natural disasters is also a large problem that our society faces. Areas where the cellular towers and power generators were knocked out would benefit greatly from connectivity because it would allow the affected community to communicate with outside help.  One example of when internet needed to be extended to an area affected by disaster is Puerto Rico after Hurricane Irma knocked out over 90% of their cell service (Fiegerman). Some companies have attempted to create solar powered wi-fi hotspots, but none of them are implemented in the way that we plan to solve the problem. No product exists that can provide internet without cellular coverage nor a power grid. However, there are a couple of products that are in our area of research. The company Soluxio has created a solar powered wi-fi extender/LTE wi-fi hotspot. This is primarily for creating outdoor wi-fi networks in places with an existing internet connection or for resorts and city parks in developed areas where LTE data is available (Soluxio). The company Moja has created a microserver that also connects to LTE data. This device has the option to be solar powered, but it also has the same limitation as the Soluxio device in that it relies on LTE data which does not cover a large portion of the globe (Moja).

Housing Design 17 Solar Panel Mount Design The only components that will not be kept in the HDPE housing will be the solar panels and satellite dish. That is why we have taken on the task to design a system/device that can provide internet to areas that do not have reliable power or cellular coverage. There are many areas in the world that do not have or have very sparse internet connections; some areas may even lack reliable power. Thesis Statement Design a system/device that can provide internet to areas that do not have reliable power or cellular coverage. Solar Panel Roof Mount The roof mount design is less expensive than the pole mount design, however it can only be used in areas with the proper infrastructure. Since many use cases for our device involves disaster relief areas, the device also needs to be able to withstand very rough climates and weather conditions. Our system is capable of producing its own power and sustaining itself and even 14 some excess power to the client. Since most of the Puerto Ricans do not have power or lights still, it would be imperative to have some sort of power source functionality. Areas where the cellular towers and power generators were knocked out would benefit greatly from connectivity because it would allow the affected community to communicate with outside help. No product exists that can provide 2 internet without cellular coverage nor a power grid.

Title: Animal Languages in the Middle Ages: Representations of Interspecies Communication
Word count: 227
Abstract: The essays in this interdisciplinary volume explore language, broadly construed, as part of the continued interrogation of the boundaries of human and nonhuman animals in the Middle Ages. Uniting a diverse set of emerging and established scholars, Animal Languages questions the assumed medieval distinction between humans and other animals. The chapters point to the wealth of non-human communicative and discursive forms through which animals function both as vehicles for human meaning and as agents of their own, demonstrating the significance of human and non-human interaction in medieval texts, particularly for engaging with the Other. The book ultimately considers the ramifications of deconstructing the medieval anthropocentric view of language for the broader question of human singularity

Title: Assessment of expression of interferon γ (IFN-G) gene and its antisense (IFNG-AS1) in breast cancer
Word count: 3148
Abstract: Background  The role of long non-coding RNAs has been extensively appreciated in the contexts of cancer. Interferon γ-antisense RNA1 (IFNG-AS1) is an lncRNA located near to IFN-γ-encoding (IFNG) gene and regulates expression of IFNG in Th1 cells. Methods  In the present study, we evaluated expression of IFNG and IFNG-AS1 in 108 breast samples including tumoral tissues and their adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANCTs) using real-time PCR. IFNG-AS1 was significantly upregulated in tumoral tissues compared with ANCTs (expression ratio = 2.23, P = 0.03). Results  Although the expression of IFNG was higher in tumoral tissues compared with ANCTs (relative expression = 1.89), it did not reach the level of significance (P = 0.07). IFNG expression was significantly higher in HER2-negative tumoral tissues compared with HER2-positive ones (P = 0.01) and in grade 1 samples compared with grade 2 ones (P = 0.03). No other significant difference was found in expressions of genes between other groups. Conclusion Significant strong correlations were detected between expression of IFNG and IFNG-AS1 in both tumoral tissues and ANCTs. The present study provides evidences for participation of IFNG and IFNG-AS1 in the pathogenesis of breast cancer and warrants future studies to elaborate the underlying mechanism

basic summary: IFNG expression was significantly higher in HER2-negative tumoral tissues compared with HER2-positive ones (P = 0.01) and in grade 1 samples compared with grade 2 ones (P = 0.03). In spite of several efforts to evaluate the effi- ciency of IFN-γ treatment in breast cancer, data regarding expression of IFNG gene in breast cancer tissues is scarce. Methods: In the present study, we evaluated expression of IFNG and IFNG-AS1 in 108 breast samples including tumoral tissues and their adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANCTs) using real-time PCR. Results: Although the expression of IFNG was higher in tumoral tissues compared with ANCTs (relative expression = 1.89), it did not reach the level of significance (P = 0.07). Expression analysis Relative expressions of IFNG and IFNG-AS1 genes were assessed in tumoral tissues and paired ANCTs in the rotor gene 6000 Corbett Real-Time PCR System. Table 3 shows the results of association analysis between relative expressions of genes in tumoral tissues compared with ANCTs and patients’ clinicopath- ological data. Elevated expression of IFNG-AS1 lncRNA has been reported in Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT) patients in correlation with the proportion of circulating Th1 cells and IFNG gene expression . We compared expression level of IFNG and IFNG-AS1 in each tumoral tissue vs. its paired ANCT and classified patients based on these values to upregulation and downregulation groups. No significant associations were found between patients’ clinicopathological data and fold changes of ex- pression of these genes in tumoral tissues compared with ANCTs.

Word count: 3707
Abstract: Background and aims: The current paper aimed to collect and document the information about medicinal plants of Boyer Ahmad and Dena regions and their applications by indigenous inhabitants. Methods: The field surveys were carried out from March 2015 to September 2016 under supervision of local people. Collected plant specimens were identified to species level using Flora of Iran and Flora Iranica. Subsequently, information including scientific names, local names, parts used, method of preparation, medicinal effects, growth forms, and chorotypes for 71 species were recorded. Results: Medicinal plants belonged to 62 genera and 29 families. Apiaceae (14.08%) and Lamiaceae (14.08%) had the most number of species among other families. Based on Raunkier method, hemicryptophytes with 42.25% is the highest growth form and the most common chorotype was Irano-Turanian type (70.42%). The most used parts are aerial parts (40/85%),‎ and the most common mode of preparation was infusion (24%). The results of this study indicate that local people in Boyer Ahmad and Dena regions have used all collected plants for medicinal, food and sanitary purposes and their knowledge about identification of plants and their habitats, medicinal and edible properties is extensive. Conclusions: Native knowledge leads to obtaining valuable information including medicinal properties of plants, usable parts, time of growth, best time for harvesting and areas which have growing potential. Therefore, it is vital to investigate the native knowledge about medicinal plants in various regions of Iran

Title: Immunotherapy in Allergic Rhinitis: It's Effect on the Immune System and Clinical Symptoms
Word count: 2998
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis is one of the most common allergic diseases and characterised by sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion and nasopharyngeal itching. Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) for specific allergens is an effective treatment and induces the inhibitory effect of T regulatory lymphocytes and decreases clinical symptoms in allergic rhinitis. AIM: In this study effect of subcutaneous immunotherapy with specific allergens on clinical symptoms and T regulatory and T Helper cells cytokines, in patients with allergic rhinitis are evaluated. METHODS: In this study, 30 patients with moderate to severe allergic rhinitis according to clinical criteria and positive skin prick test for aeroallergens were selected and treated by SCIT. Clinical symptoms and T cells cytokines IL4, IL17, IFN gamma, TGF beta, GITR, FOXP3 and IL-10 (by RT-PCR) were evaluated before and one year after initiation of treatment. RESULTS: Thirty (30) patients with allergic rhinitis at age range 15-45 years old were treated by SCIT, and 23 (14 female, 9 male) patients continued the study, and 7 patients did not continue treatment. After immunotherapy, clinical symptoms decreased significantly. The specific cytokines TGF beta and IL10 levels increased and changes were statistically significant. (Respectively P = 0.013 and P = 0.05) The IL17 level was also increased, but not statistically significant. (P = 0.8) IFN gamma, IL4, GITR, FOXP3, all decreased, but the changes were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Subcutaneous Immunotherapy for specific allergens decreases clinical symptoms in patients with allergic rhinitis and induces tolerance in T lymphocytes, especially by increasing T regulatory cells cytokines, TGF beta and IL10

It seems that immunotherapy has a major role in the induction of specific Treg cells and that the induction of tolerance in T lymphocytes is the base of immunotherapy. In our study, a significant decrease was observed in the clinical symptoms of allergic rhinitis patients after immunotherapy. Natural Treg cells react to autoantibodies which are expressed in the thymus whereas Inducable Treg cells react towards peripheral antigens which are expressed by dendritic cells . In the mentioned study those Treg cells originating from the thymus were named as nT-reg cells, and those forming outside the thymus were called aT-reg (adaptive) cells . In a study by Jutel et al., in 2003 in Switzerland, the mechanism of immunotherapy was studied in HDM- sensitive patients after 70 days of immunotherapy. The present study aimed at evaluating the effect of immunotherapy on the clinical symptoms and cytokine changes related to T lymphocytes in moderate to severe AR patients. Each of these subsets has a specific marker and express their specific receptors which for nTreg cells include CCR4/GITR/CTLA4/CD62L and for iTreg cells include IL10/TGF-beta.

Twenty three (23) individuals, 9 males and 14 females, completed the study. After immunotherapy, clinical symptoms decreased significantly. Moreover, IL15 which is one of the main factors in the survival and growth of T-cells is inhibited by IL10 and TGF-β [7]. One of the main characteristics of Treg cells is the expression of FOXP3 in them. Clinical symptoms and T cells cytokines IL4, IL17, IFN gamma, TGF beta, GITR, FOXP3 and IL-10 (by RT-PCR) were evaluated before and one year after initiation of treatment. Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Also, the inhibitory effects of IL10 on T-lymphocytes were due to changes in the CD28 mediated signalling pathway while the inhibitory effects of TGF-β were due to its inhibitory effect on TCR/CD3 and the inhibition of the CD28 pathway. It has been proved that following immunotherapy, the presence of FOXP3+ cells is increased in the nasal mucosa and this increase is consistent with the improvement of allergic rhinitis [4] [12].

AIM: In this study effect of subcutaneous immunotherapy with specific allergens on clinical symptoms and T  regulatory and T Helper cells cytokines, in patients with allergic rhinitis are evaluated. In a study by L.  Cosmi et al., on the effects of SLIT in allergic rhinitis  patients and mite-sensitive asthma, immunologic  changes included reduced allergen-specific IgE and  increased TGF-β, IL10 and IFN-γ levels [20]. Natural Treg  cells react to autoantibodies which are expressed in  the thymus whereas Inducable Treg cells react  towards peripheral antigens which are expressed by  dendritic cells [1] [11] [12]. Regarding the obtained results from this  study, it seems that the immunologic mechanism  leading to the alleviation and improvement of  symptoms in AR patients mainly includes a rise in the  number of inducible Treg cells accompanied by  increased TGF-β and IL10 levels. Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) for specific  allergens is an effective treatment and induces the inhibitory effect of T regulatory lymphocytes and decreases  clinical symptoms in allergic rhinitis. They stated  that an increase in the number of Treg, CD25+ and  CD4+ cells in allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT)  has a significant role and that immunotherapy with the  grass group will result in increased IL10 and TGF-β  expression in T cells and the mucosa. In the  mentioned study those Treg cells originating from the  thymus were named as nT-reg cells, and those  forming outside the thymus were called aT-reg  (adaptive) cells [15] [17]. Although FOXP3 is expressed to a lesser  degree by T-effector cells, the amount is very small,  and it is expressed transiently; therefore FOXP3 is  considered as a specific marker for Treg cells only  [13] [15]. RESULTS: Thirty (30) patients with allergic rhinitis at age range 15-45 years old were treated by SCIT, and 23 (14  female, 9 male) patients continued the study, and 7 patients did not continue treatment.

Title: Effects of Zingiber officinale hydro-alcoholic extract on\udHMG-COA reductase level in the testis of streptozotocininduced diabetic rats
Word count: 3553
Abstract: Introduction: Zingiber officinale Roscoe, commonly known as ginger, is used as a cooking spice and therapeutically for its antioxidant and androgenic activities. We investigated the effects of Z. officinale hydro-alcoholic extract on HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase level in the testis of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Methods: The current experimental study was performed on four groups of male Wistar rats one of them was kept as a healthy control, while the others were rendered diabetic via a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (60 mg kg-1). One group was considered as diabetic control; while the others were given orally hydro-alcoholic extract (200 and 400 mg kg-1) for 56 consecutive days. Body weight, blood glucose and insulin concentrations were evaluated using standard methods. The HMG-COA reductase level was determined by western blot analysis. Results: Treatment with the extract resulted in a significant reduction of serum glucose concentration and HMG-COA reductase level in the rat’s testis compared to diabetic controls (P<0.01). A significant increase in body weight was observed in treated diabetic rats. Also, serum insulin was significantly increased in diabetic rats treated with 400 mg/kg of the extract compared to diabetic controls (P<0.05). Conclusion: Ginger has a potential influence on the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis by modulating of HMG-COA reductase level. The results provide scientific evidence to confirm the traditional use of Z. officinale in the treatment of diabetes mellitus

basic summary: On the other hand, serum insulin level was significantly higher in diabetic rats treated with 400 mg/kg of Z. officinale extract than diabetic controls (29,30). Conclusion The oral administration of Z. officinale hydro-alcoholic extract has been shown to increases body weight, reduce blood glucose concentration and improve serum insulin levels in STZ-induced diabetic rats. Raw ginger extract can decrease serum cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels in diabetic rats and it has the great effect for controlling of diabetic complications (32). We investigated the effects of Z. officinale hydro-alcoholic extract on HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase level in the testis of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. According to the present study, Z. officinale extract can prevent weight loss in rats with STZ-induced diabetic and this effect may be related to its hypoglycemic properties. Some studies have shown that the ethanol extract of Z. officinale alleviates plasma lipids in cholesterol fed hyperlipidemia rabbits (12,13) and in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats (14). Also, serum insulin was significantly increased in diabetic rats treated with 400 mg/kg of the extract compared to diabetic controls (P < 0.05). Results: Treatment with the extract resulted in a significant reduction of serum glucose concentration and HMG-COA reductase level in the rat’s testis compared to diabetic controls (P < 0.01). Anti- diabetic and anti-oxidant effects of Zingiber officinale on alloxan-induced and insulin-resistant diabetic male rats. The effect of Z. officinale extract on the body weight, insulin level, and fasting blood glucose concentrations were assessed and the results are presented elsewhere (19).

Title: ANCAMAN SERANGAN CYBER DALAM KASUS PANAMA\udPAPERS DAN PENGARUHNYA TERHADAP STABILITAS\udPOLITIK ISLANDIA
Word count: 816
Abstract: Saat ini ketergantungan kita terhadap teknologi informasi telah meningkatkan kekhawatiran internasional akan keamanan informasi dan cyber dalam menghadapi serangan cyber yang bermotif politik, sosial dan agama. Panama Papers merupakan salah satu bentuk ancaman nyata dari serangan cyber. Karena serangan cyber dan kemampuan pertahanan terus berkembang dengan cepat, berbagai masalah yang terkait dengan kebijakan dan praktik dunia maya akan semakin meningkat dan akan memerlukan strategi keamanan nasional dan hubungan internasional yang komprehensif, salah satunya adalah negara Islandia. Setelah kebocoran Panama Papers, di negara tersebut terjadi protes baik dari lawan politik maupun dari masyarakat Islandia yang menuntut pengunduran Perdana Menteri negara tersebut. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk memberikan jawaban akan masalah yang diteliti yaitu untuk mengetahui dan menganalisa ancaman yang ditimbulkan oleh serangan cyber dari segi politik, keamanan, dan ekonomi dalam kasus Panama Papers. dalam penelitian ini yaitu stabilitas politik negara Islandia. Metode penelitian yang digunakan adalah jenis metode kualitatif yaitu penelitian tentang riset yang bersifat deskriptif dan cenderung menggunakan analisis. Selain itu penulis menggunakan metode historis analisis untuk menggambarkan peristiwa masa lampau agar dapat memahami peristiwa masa saat ini dan kemungkinan perkembangannya di masa mendatang. Panama Papers adalah kebocoran dari basis data firma hukum lepas pantai, Mossack Fonseca. Tax Havens memudahkan orang untuk menghindar dari membayar pajak kepada pemerintah mereka. Di antara para pemimpin nasional dengan kekayaan lepas pantai, salah satunya adalah perdana menteri Islandia, Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson. Setelah adanya Panama Papers, sejumlah anggota parlemen Islandia mengkritik peraturan yang ditetapkan oleh Perdana Menteri, dan masyarakat melakukan protes massa dengan menyerukan pemerintah untuk mengundurkan diri serta melakukan pemilihan baru. Kata Kunci: Serangan Cyber, Panama Papers, Stabilitas Politik Islandi

Title: Digital work design : the interplay of human and computer in future work practices as an interdisciplinary (grand) challenge
Word count: 3541
Abstract: Erworben im Rahmen der Schweizer Nationallizenzen (http://www.nationallizenzen.ch)More and more academic studies and practitioner reports claim that human work is increasingly disrupted or even determined by information and communication technology (ICT) (Cascio and Montealegre 2016). This will make a considerable share of jobs currently performed by humans susceptible to automation (e.g., Frey and Osborne 2017; Manyika et al. 2017). These reports often sketch a picture of ‘machines taking over’ traditional domains like manufacturing, while ICT advances and capabilities seem to decide companies’ fate. Consequently, ICT is often put at the core of innovative efforts. While this applies to nearly all areas of workplace design, a recent popular example of increasing technology centricity is ‘Industry 4.0’, which is often delineated as ‘machines talking to computers’

basic summary: Digital work designers must understand how and why things work before they can provide a digital solution to support work practices. 1 shows, traditional work design touches on motivational (e.g., autonomy and task variety), social (e.g., interdependence), and contextual (e.g., ergonomics) work design characteristics. 2 The Roots and Key Characteristics of Digital Work Design Workplace design has a long-standing tradition in ergo- nomics (Luczak 2013) and human-oriented computer sci- ence (Floyd et al.

Title: On the Obsolescence of Bourgeois Theory in the Anthropocene
Word count: 2421
Abstract: ‘On the Obsolescence of Bourgeois Theory in the Anthropocene’ is an attempt to think theory beyond the stereotypes of what it is considered to be. This includes preconceived notions of what it is to be a  theorist, and to create, publish and disseminate critical theory.Many thinkers, for example, are currently attempting to replace the tyranny of the human with an emphasis on the nonhuman, the posthuman and the Anthropocene. Yet such ‘post-theory’ theorists continue to remain bound up with the human in the very performance of their attempts to think through and beyond it. Regardless of the anti-humanist philosophies they profess — be they inspired by Deleuze, Kittler or Latour  — in their practices, in the forms their work takes, in the ways they create, publish and disseminate it, in their associated upholding of notions of individual human rights, freedom, property and so on, they continue to operate in terms of a liberal, humanist model of what it is to be and do as a theorist. ‘On the Obsolescence of Bourgeois Theory in the Anthropocene’ thus asks, what forms is critical theory to take if, in its performance, it is not to be simply liberal and humanist — nor indeed human — but something else besides? In this way it endeavours to anticipate a future where new roles and conditions for theory materialize that has never previously been imagined
basic similarity: 0.5759620106791554
basic summary: The nonhuman may be what a lot of contemporary theory studies and writes about, then, but it cannot take seriously the implications of the nonhuman for theory. Like the bourgeois novel, such theory — with rare exceptions — ‘draws a sharp distinction between the human and the nonhuman’, not to mention the ‘collective and collaborative’. Certainly, from the point of view of bourgeois theory, that which is outside its inherited liberal humanist frame in this respect can only appear as ‘strange’, ‘weird’, ‘freaky’. Just as ‘serious fiction, like bourgeois culture, now seems rather unserious, indeed frivolous’, so too does serious theory. For if the inhuman equals the human intertwined with the nonhuman, then a humanities with this intra-active inhuman figure at their heart must become the inhumanities. For ours is a time when theory too can be said to obscure rather than express the changing nature of the times and the time of nature.

Title: Improving Transformational Teaching and Learning by Advancing Higher Education Feedback-Based Dialogues at Texas A&M University
Word count: 3244
Abstract: Feedback mechanisms are critical to iteratively improving most societal systems, and yet there is minimal documentation on the best practices of leveraging feedback to improve teaching and learning in higher education. We attest that facilitated dialogues have the potential to start conversations relevant to improving policy that otherwise would not transpire. In higher education, facilitated dialogues between students, faculty, staff, and administration provide a unique face-to-face opportunity for all participants to provide feedback to one another on real-time institutional strengths and weaknesses. More specifically, facilitated dialogues have the potential to start a conversation on improving the learning in higher education. This work notes the theory facilitated dialogues and offers discussion on the long-term potential for such conversations to serve as a medium for iterative feedback in larger societal systems. Further, this thesis documents our development of a facilitated dialogue, The Student-Faculty Dialogue, which will act as a plenary event at Texas A&M?s inaugural Transformational Teaching and Learning Conference on April 17, 2018

Title: Identification and Characterization of a Mutated Gene Affecting NPC assembly
Word count: 3481
Abstract: The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a gateway that controls what is exchanged across the nuclear envelope. Therefore, when something affects its assembly, the cell will die. The laboratory has a collection of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant strains with NPC assembly defects, but where these defects are located and how they are related to NPC assembly remains unknown. The goal of this project is to identify the mutated gene that is causing assembly defects within one of the strains. Fluorescent microscopy was used to confirm the presence of a NPC assembly defect, and the growth rate of the mutant strain was measured at the permissive and nonpermissive temperature. Additionally, a genomic library was used to compliment the temperature sensitive defect as well as NPC assembly defect. Fluorescent microscopy confirmed the presence of an assembly defect. It was additionally found that the growth rate of the mutant was significantly slower at the nonpermissive temperature. Upon completing all transformations, none of the plasmids in the genomic library rescued the mutant. With information still missing by the mechanism of which NPC?s are formed, identifying and characterizing genes that affect NPC assembly can lead to more information about it
basic similarity: 0.7520913774905431
basic summary: Fluorescent microscopy was used to confirm the presence of a NPC assembly defect, and the growth rate of the mutant strain was measured at the permissive and nonpermissive temperature. Indeed, the wild-type cells shows a bright and continuous GFP pattern around the nucleus, indicating normal assembly and functioning nuclear pore assembly (npa) genes. Identifying genes that affect nuclear pore complex assembly, or the nuclear pore complex itself, provide more information about this vital process in every eukaryotic organism. This difference in growth rate signifies that the npa mutant of KRY141 is temperature sensitive and will fail to adequately grow when shifted to the nonpermissive temperature. A yeast genomic library (collection of genomic DNA from yeast) was used to rescue the mutation in order to learn more about what genes affect assembly. Additionally, a tiled genomic library was used to compliment the temperature sensitive defect as well as NPC assembly defect. The growth rates at room temperature were later used in comparison with the growth rates at the nonpermissive temperature. Genomic Complementation As seen from Table 2, none of the plasmids in the Prelich library were able to successfully rescue the temperature sensitive mutant phenotype (Jones, Prelich et. Doubling times of the wild-type and mutant strains were found at room temperature in order to establish their normal growth rate. As seen in Table 1, the slower doubling time between KRY141 and YGS53 at the nonpermissive temperature supports the fact that the npa defect is temperature sensitive.

text_rank summary: Indeed,  the wild-type cells shows a bright and continuous GFP pattern around the nucleus, indicating  normal assembly and functioning nuclear pore assembly (npa) genes.Genomic Complementation  As seen from Table 2, none of the plasmids in the Prelich library were able to  successfully rescue the temperature sensitive mutant phenotype (Jones, Prelich et.Given that there is still missing information about the assembly  process, there are several possibilities that this gene could encode for.My project is different because it will address a different  gene, but I will use similar materials and methods to achieve an answer to the research question.Doubling times of the wild-type and mutant strains were found at room temperature in order to  establish their normal growth rate.The slower doubling time could result from the  fact that important proteins, mRNA, and other essential cell components are impeded when  crossing the nuclear membrane if the NPCs are not assembled correctly.While the  possibility exists that the gene is contained in the Prelich library, Table 2 shows that the  probability that this plasmid is present in the library is incredibly low.One of the plates  of transformed cells was kept at room temperature to grow to assess how many should have been  seen at 34°C.Given that there are still several unknown steps in the process of NPC assembly,  identification of this gene should give the scientific community more insight.Using a mutant from the bank mentioned earlier, my project will focus on the  identification of the gene causing a mutated phenotype in the NPC.

tfidf summary: Genomic Complementation to Identify the Mutant Gene In an attempt to identify the gene affecting NPC assembly, complementation of the temperature sensitive mutant phenotype was done through a series of transformations using pools from the Prelich library (Jones, Prelich et. The NPC is also thought to play a role in cell division, including chromatin silencing. This number was then divided by 96, the number of plasmids in each pool. Figure 1. al 2008). The data was graphed using Excel in order to find an equation for the best fit line and the standard deviation. Upon completing all transformations, none of the plasmids in the genomic library rescued the mutant. Peering through the Pore: Nuclear Pore Complex Structure, Assembly, and Function. Meanwhile the mutant strain is characterized by mislocalization and discontinuous GFP patterns about the nucleus. To determine P(0), first, the number of colonies were counted at room temperature then multiplied by two in order to account for the fact that two plates were shifted to the nonpermissive temperature per transformation.

GFP-Nup Patterns  Since NPC assembly is essential for the NPC’s characteristic bidirectional transport, a  bank of yeast with temperature sensitive defects was generated and screened for mutations (Ryan  and Wente, 2002). Identifying genes that affect nuclear pore complex assembly, or the  nuclear pore complex itself, provide more information about this vital process in every  eukaryotic organism.

Title: APLIKASI THERMO-ELECTRIC GENERATOR PADA SISTEM\udPEMANEN PANAS BUANG PADA KOMPOR GAS SATU TUNGKU
Word count: 2049
Abstract: Pada saat memasak tidak semua panas diserap oleh panci atau pun masakan, tetapi ada panas yang terbuang di sekitar panci. Panas yang terbuang itulah yang akan dipergunakan sebagai energi alternatif. Alat yang mampu mengubah energi panas menjadi energi listrik adalah Thermo-Electric Generator (TEG). TEG adalah alat yang menggunakan prinsip kerja dari efek Seebeck. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah memanen panas buang dari gas buang samping panci yang sedang digunakan untuk memasak menjadi energi listrik serta membuat desain selimut TEG yang fleksibel, dalam artian mampu digunakan untuk dimensi kompor apapun dalam rumah tangga. Listrik yang dihasilkan dapat digunakan untuk proses kebutuhan listrik rumah tangga lainnya. Setelah dilakukannya pengujian diketahui bahwa terdapat beda temperatur (∆T) yang dihasilkan sehingga terdapat arus dan tegangan yang cukup dan bisa disambungkan dengan voltage regulator usb agar dapat digunakan untuk mengisi daya handphone dan semacamnya. Dapat disimpulkan panci yang berdiameter 140 mm dengan tinggi 110 mm memiliki ∆T yang konstan pada saat Api Kecil baris Bawah yaitu sisi Kiri = 8,7 °C; sisi tengah = 10,23 °C; dan sisi Kanan = 12,37 °C.

I.3 Tujuan dan Manfaat Penelitian Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah memanen panas buang kompor gas satu tungku yang sedang digunakan untuk memasak menjadi energi listrik. Panas yang terbuang itulah yang akan dipergunakan kembali sebagai energi alternatif yang bisa berguna untuk keperluan lainnya. Pada daerah sekitar panci terdapat panas yang terbuang atau yang tidak digunakan untuk proses memasak. TEG adalah alat yang menggunakan prinsip kerja dari efek Seebeck yang mampu mengubah energi thermal menjadi listrik. Pembangkit-pembangkit tersebut menghasilkan panas yang terbuang atau tidak digunakan yang dihasilkan bisa dari cerobong hingga generator. Panas yang terbuang tersebut bisa digunakan kembali menjadi energi alternatif lain yang berguna. Dikarenakan TEG memiliki ukuran yang cukup kecil sehingga mudah untuk diaplikasi kan pada lingkup rumah tangga dan aman digunakan disekitar manusia.

Title: Evaluation on the Effectiveness and Usability of the Developed  Collaborative Interaction Management System
Word count: 3673
Abstract: A Collaborative Interaction Management System (CIMS) is a system that potentially provide some assistance to the teachers in managing the studentâ€™s collaborative interaction in forum discussions. The projected main function of the CIMS is to provide tools that automatically gauge the quality of interaction as reflected in studentâ€™s individual contributions so as to make it easier for the instructor to make judgments on the effectiveness of the collaborative process. This study aims to assess&nbsp;&nbsp; how effective and usable is the developed CIMS based on the evaluation of faculty and students. The descriptive research design is utilized in this study. The five-point Likert scale is used and the gathered data are statistically interpreted through the utilisation of a weighted mean. The sample population of this study is the one hundred twenty participants coming from the different universities in the area where the survey was conducted. The researcher adopted a survey instrument made by some software specialists. The bases of the instrument are some of the characteristics listed on the software quality model of ISO 9126. These are the functionality, usability and the reliability. Each of these software characteristics is described by some indicators to obtain the responses of the participants. The overall evaluation of the participants displayed the weighted mean of 4.0, thus it can be concluded that the functionality, usability and reliability of the software is very good

Title: Artificial intelligence in cardiology : applications, benefits and challenges
Word count: 2063
Abstract: Evidently, the potential benefits of AI in cardiology are enormous.  However, such benefits are not without challenges.  First, there are clear benefits for improving work productivity. There are currently fewer physicians to care for an ever - increasing aging population (WHO 2016). AI can support, rather than replace physicians, generating time - and cost - saving benefits for them and their patients and enabling more compassionate and thorough interactions. However, as more tasks become automated, there are possibilities that fewer physicians will be required to work or that fewer will do so on a full - time basis, since many tasks could be delivered through platforms by part-time, freelancer physicians. This may impact the relationship between patients, physicians and administrative staff in healthcare systems
basic similarity: 0.25380433780219774
basic summary: Machine learning can positively impact cardiovascular disease prediction and diagnosis by developing algorithms that can model representations of data, much faster and more efficiently than physicians can. Thus, results from unsupervised learning algorithms can feed into supervised learning algorithms for predictive modelling. To develop such intelligent systems machine learning algorithms are required to enable dynamic learning capabilities in relation to changing conditions. Such predictive models can be produced with “supervised learning” algorithms that require a dataset with predictor variables and labeled outcomes (Johnson et al 2018). 3 Increased data storage, high computing power and exponential learning capabilities together enable computers to learn much faster than humans and address the challenge of limitless choice. This may impact the relationship between patients, physicians and administrative staff in healthcare systems (see Taylor et al 2016). What matters the most is the clinical efficacy of algorithms and their use of data (Future Advocacy 2018).

Title: The effect of informal Central Bank communication : machine learning approach
Word count: 803
Abstract: The management of agents’ expectations is a key feature of monetary policy because the central bank only has direct control over very short-term interest rates. The main tool to influence people’s expectations is communication. A number of both qualitative formal (e.g. statements and minutes) and informal (speeches) channels as well as quantitative channels, such as economic projections, are currently used by policymakers. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the effects of central bank communication can contribute to effective monetary policy. For instance, it may help the European Central Bank to phase out the quantitative easing without causing severe instability. It is important to emphasise that this research is not about explicit forward guidance but instead focuses on the overall positive or negative sentiment (tone) about economic conditions in speeches. The paper investigates three hypotheses regarding the effect of positive or negative sentiment (tone) about economic conditions conveyed in Bank of England speeches on government bond yields in the United Kingdom: (H1) A positive sentiment (tone) about economic conditions conveyed in speeches should have a positive effect on bond yields. (H2) The impact of a speech should vary by the position of a speaker. Speeches by more senior people should have a larger effect. (H3) The stock of communication matters. If there was little communication prior to the speech, the impact of a speech should be larger
basic similarity: 0.6280797300963465
basic summary: Finally, the sentiment index is calculated by counting the number of positive and negative words in relevant parts of speeches. The estimates should be close to true values as there are not many factors that affect bond yields and are correlated with the sentiment index. A standard-deviation increase in the sentiment index leads to around a 1–1.7 basis point rise in the bond yields across the curve. Such use is not ideal as markets should react only to the surprise component of the sentiment (the difference between the absolute index and its expectations). The magnitude of the effect is similar to that for the surprise component of consumer price index (CPI) data releases. It would be interesting to estimate the effect for a longer horizon than one day to investigate whether the effect persists. statements and minutes) and informal (speeches) channels as well as quantitative channels, such as economic projections, are currently used by policymakers. Primary limitations of this research are related to measurement error in the sentiment index. In addition, an absolute index, which ignores market expectations, has been used due to the lack of data. if there was no communication in the week prior to the speech, the effect is two- to three- times larger. For example, ‘increasing risk’ and ‘increasing growth’ would both be classified as positive phrases even though the former is clearly negative. The methodology to estimate the sentiment index can be applied to other contexts.

Finally, the sentiment index is calculated by counting the number of positive and negative words in relevant parts of speeches. After calculating the sentiment index, daily changes in the yields of two-, five- and ten-year government bonds are regressed on lagged values of the dependent variable, the sentiment index and control variables (monetary surprises and surprise components of macroeconomic data releases) in order to account for factors that can affect bond yields during the day.

Title: How am I integrating the personal and political in improving professional practice and generating educational knowledge with collaborative/cooperative action research?
Word count: 2088
Abstract: A summary of a paper presented at the CARN 40th Anniversary Conference at Bishop Grosseteste University in Lincoln, UK, 10-13 November 2016, with the theme of 'Integrating the Personal and Political in Professional Practice'.

Title: Editorial: Practitioner Research in Higher Education, 11 (1)
Word count: 1570
Abstract: This special issue of Practitioner Research in Higher Education focuses specifically on assessment and feedback. We know that assessment has a powerful influence on student engagement and learning, making it an important focus for enhancement activity. We also know, however, that assessment is a nuanced, complex and contested area of university practice, which makes it a notoriously challenging one to change. Heightened awareness of the centrality of assessment-related matters, a commitment to scholarly endeavour and the processes of conducting, sharing and debating diverse approaches and perspectives are all vital. The two research papers and nine evaluation studies of innovative practice in this issue provide insight into the ways that many academics are, in various ways, investigating and enhancing their practice in this important area

Title: Digital skills, confidence and motivation: technology supported authentic learning in journalism education
Word count: 1149
Abstract: This study explores the use of technology to incorporate authentic learning practices into the Review and Lifestyle Journalism module at Staffordshire University. The research takes a constructivist view, considering both tutor observation and student feedback to evaluate an experiential journalism project, StaffsLive Reviews, developed in the academic year 2016-17. Here authentic learning is defined as designing activities to provide meaningful, ‘real-life’ situations which are relevant from a student’s perspective, while providing protective scaffolding to support learning (Icuc and Marin 2014 and Stein 2004). This encapsulates a broader institutional focus on employability, by designing activities that closely match ‘real-world’ tasks of media professionals (Lombardi 2007)
basic similarity: 0.42031128939819795
basic summary: Students choosing to stay involved in the project outside of any formal assessment indicates a deeper level learning that could positively influence a propensity for life-long learning (Foresight 2017). Authentic learning in this way enables students to use their skills and knowledge in the same way a professional would. This study explores the use of technology to incorporate authentic learning practices into the Review and Lifestyle Journalism module at Staffordshire University. In journalism, digital platforms have enabled students to publish and share work with a wider community outside of their university course.

James  Crabbe FRSA asks how far we have really moved since.In his influential book published in 1968  the British criminologist, Nigel Walker, set out what he believed should be the aims of a  penal system: to protect offenders and suspected offenders against unofficial retaliation; and  to reduce the frequency of the types of behaviour prohibited by criminal law. In seeking to  meet these aims, Walker adds that the penal system should seek to cause the minimum of  suffering (whether to offenders or to others) and be designed to ensure that it would not  increase the incidence of offences.

Title: Translating Gesture from Sculpture to Text
Word count: 3826
Abstract: This is a collaborative practice-based investigation which aims to outline some of the key lessons and implications from a number of the uses of gesture in the sculpture of Barbara Hepworth. This mini-research project consists of this formal academic paper and a selection of digital multimedia poetry which functions as a creative-critical intervention and a component part of this paper. The digital multimedia poetry was created in collaboration by the authors in response to Hepworth’s original sculpture at the Barbara Hepworth Museum (St Ives) and the Hepworth Wakefield (Yorkshire). The creative element of the investigation attempts to model Hepworth’s use of gesture and in doing so translate the function of gesture from its use in a visual arts practice to a multimedia textual practice. Building on a multi-disciplinary understanding of gesture and Hepworth’s own ideas about “gesture in landscape”, the project considers the gestures of the artist, gestures represented in the artwork, and gestures choreographed by the artwork (in the reader/audience/participant). The collaboration features new interactive works and is intended to function as a provocation raising questions about the interaction between tension and gesture in both sculptural and digital textual practices, rather than an authoritative, exhaustive or conclusive typology of the use of gesture in Hepworth’s corpus
basic similarity: 0.68636738431871
basic summary: Indeed the gesture of formation of an artwork creates a dynamic tension between the gesture of the artist and the virtual formation of that being represented. In those previously discussed works which enact gesture in landscape (drawing upon waves, natural rock forms, and sea caves) the repeated actions of nature are inscribed within the form. (Hepworth 5) 15A third use of gesture in Hepworth’s work is the gesture of invitation. It features eighteen digital poems created collaboratively which attempt to implement the three different uses of gesture in Hepworth’s work identified above. There is room for development in both the practice work and in sketching out a fuller typology of gesture as it functions in Hepworth’s work. Yet we have begun with an identification of gestures of tension, formation and invitation, and these functions have proved a useful starting point for new collaborative practice.

Hepworth  © Bowness    Figure 6: Barbara Heptworth, Pendour (1947). Hepworth  © Bowness   11When describing “gesture in landscape” in her autobiography, Hepworth nods to some of these forces in  her own work:  In all these shapes the translation of what one feels about man and nature much be conveyed by  the sculptor in terms of mass, inner tension and rhythm, scale in relation to our human size and  the quality of surface which speaks through our hands and eyes. Hepworth ©  Bowness   10Implosion too is an implied future action, another “about to happen” that can be read in some of  Hepworth’s pieces. Hepworth © Bowness    16Hepworth herself invites the audience to be embraced by the pierced form:  The forms which have had special meaning to me since childhood have been the standing form  (which is the translation of my feeling towards the human being standing in landscape); the two  forms (which is the tender relationship of one living thing beside another); and the closed form,  such as the oval, spherical or pierced form (sometimes incorporating colour) which translates  for me the association and meaning of gesture in landscape; in the repose of say a mother and  child, or the feeling of the embrace of living things, either in nature or the human spirit.

text_rank summary: Conclusion  22In the course of the research for this project, which saw us draw upon our existing personal relationships  with the relevant landscapes and each other’s practice (in addition to the usual book-based research and  museum visits), we have made inroads into both emergent digital poetry practice methods and our  understanding of the function of gesture in Hepworth’s sculpture.Interestingly the impact of translating this shaping function into  our practice, has led to a number of the virtual works taking on a distinctly sculptural quality.4  6The next portion of the paper outlines and defines three uses of gesture (as defined above) which we have  identified in Hepworth’s sculpture: gestures of tension, gestures of formation and gestures of invitation.This gesture towards past action is not unusual in  choreography and performing arts (consider for instance the clown drawing a tear on his face, expressing  that he has been made sad by the previous event), but it is especially pertinent to static art forms where  gesture is the gateway to the experience of formation.This specificity does not translate well to  all practices, notably in the use of gesture in music and the acoustic arts in which the shape that implies  action need not be tied to the human form.Hepworth © Bowness    16Hepworth herself invites the audience to be embraced by the pierced form:  The forms which have had special meaning to me since childhood have been the standing form  (which is the translation of my feeling towards the human being standing in landscape); the two  forms (which is the tender relationship of one living thing beside another); and the closed form,  such as the oval, spherical or pierced form (sometimes incorporating colour) which translates  for me the association and meaning of gesture in landscape; in the repose of say a mother and  child, or the feeling of the embrace of living things, either in nature or the human spirit.Figure 1: The researchers on St Mary’s, Isles of Scilly    Gesture  2This research project involves attempting to translate “gesture” as an art function across two very different  art practices, cultures and media-forms.

This project considers the gestures of the artist, gestures represented in the artwork, and gestures choreographed by the artwork (in the reader/audience/participant). Building on a multi-disciplinary understanding of gesture and Hepworth’s own ideas about “gesture in landscape”, the project considers the gestures of the artist, gestures represented in the artwork, and gestures choreographed by the artwork (in the reader/audience/participant). In physics, tension is a force and a type of potential energy stored within matter: here too a future action or movement is implied. 13Aside from the literal sculpting work and craftsmanship involved, some works imply alternative conceptual formations.

frequency summary: Gestures of Tension  7If gesture is a shape which implies action, gestures of tension are those shapes whose implied action takes  place in the future; gestures of tension suggest that something is “about to happen” and express imminence,  and this is analogous to the way the term “tension” is used in narrative studies (e.g. The first four poems are image-based and use projective  verse, open form and visual techniques to create gestural textual environments; this is particularly apparent  in the precarious forms in “Zennor Carn” and “Lanson” and the unstable three-line stanza in “Lankidden”. These poems attempt to bring together some of the ideas and functions  from the “Kinetic” and “Static” works, and most attempt to implement one or more of the gesture functions  identified in Hepworth’s work. Le texte est destiné  à provoquer, par l’emploi d’oeuvres interactives, la réflexion sur les liens entre tension et geste en sculpture et dans les  textes numériques, plutôt qu’à cataloguer les gestes chez Hepworth dans le but d’en faire une typologie exhaustive. This mini-research  project consists of this formal academic paper and a selection of digital multimedia poetry which functions  as a creative-critical intervention and a component part of this paper.1 The digital multimedia poetry was  created in collaboration by the authors in response to Hepworth’s original sculpture at the Barbara  Hepworth Museum (St Ives) and the Hepworth Wakefield (Yorkshire). Put simply digital poetry is poetic practice which necessarily  involves the use of computational devices or digital media, and it is a subset of electronic literature, which  refers to “works with important literary aspects that take advantage of the capabilities and contexts  provided by the stand-alone or networked computer” (ELO).5 This medium for poetry affords great  potential for creating virtual poetry environments which a reader can navigate and interact with and there  is a rich tradition of works which take advantage of that potential (consider for instance “Poemas no meio  do caminho” by Rui Torres).

Title: The impact of communities of practice on masters dissertations: a small scale case Study of MSc project management students
Word count: 3177
Abstract: Communities of Practice (CoPs) are known to increase knowledge sharing and personal development. In this pilot study in a UK higher education institution, we explored using CoPs with Postgraduate (Masters and PhD) students with a view to investigating the CoPs’ impact on the Masters students’ dissertation engagement and achievement.  We conducted action research, forming 4 CoPs, each including 1 PhD student and approximately 3 MSc students. We analysed the 11 MSc Project Management students’ engagement, results and feedback and the 4 Project Management PhD researchers’ feedback using mixed methods from questionnaires, feedback forums and quantitative analysis of dissertation results (marks). We found four categories of outcome: (i) MSc students’ mode of communication with their CoP; (ii) MSc students’ contribution to their CoP; (iii) benefits to MSc students; and (iv) impact on MSc dissertation results. Our outcomes show that the CoP had an impact on MSc student engagement and performance, and indicate CoPs as worthy of further investigation for enhancing students’ learning experience

basic summary: The Masters students were full‐time MSc Project Management students, 8 were international students and the remaining 3 were home students. The final dissertation marks indicated that five students achieved Distinction (>=70%) for their dissertation and all these students had High or Medium engagement with their CoP. 5.0 Conclusion A pilot study was used to investigate the impact of ‘Communities of Practice’ on MSc Project Management students’ engagement and achievement in their dissertation. This study aims to investigate the impact of the CoPs on MSc Project Management students’ dissertation experience by evaluating student engagement and results. The empirical setting for this study is the University of Bedfordshire MSc Project Management course, involving 11 Masters students, with 4 PhD research students, each supporting a CoP. This study used both secondary and primary data; The secondary data included existing literature and archival statistical records of previous students’ performance at the dissertation stage.

sim_matrix summary: The  outcome  of  this  study  indicates  that  the MSc  students  found  the  CoPs  to  be  helpful  and  the  students who better engaged with their CoP achieved higher Dissertation classifications, which led to  a higher percentage of Distinction grades, than in the previous years before CoPs were introduced. The  mixed  method  approach  helps  to  enhance  the  findings  of  the  study  (Bryman  and  Bell,  2011). This  study  aims  to  investigate  the  impact  of  the  CoPs  on  MSc  Project  Management  students’  dissertation experience by evaluating student engagement and results. This  study  is  the  first  stage  of  a  longitudinal  action  research  project, where  the CoP  concept was  investigated  through a  teaching  and  learning project  in  the 2015‐16 academic year,  funded by  the  Centre of Learning Excellence (CLE) at the University of Bedfordshire Business School. 5.0 Conclusion  A  pilot  study  was  used  to  investigate  the  impact  of  ‘Communities  of  Practice’  on  MSc  Project  Management  students’  engagement  and  achievement  in  their  dissertation. Secondly,  the  investigation of CoPs as vehicles  for professional development  for  the PhD  students  is  to be  investigated  and  thirdly,  the  involvement of  the APM  to  identify  subject  specific resources which can be used in the CoPs will be exploited.

Title: Infrared spectroscopy of the merger candidate KIC 9832227
Word count: 2997
Abstract: Context. It has been predicted that the object KIC 9832227 – a contact binary star – will undergo a merger in 2022.2±0.7.We describe the near infrared spectrum of this object as an impetus to obtain pre-merger data. Aims. We aim to characterise (i) the nature of the individual components of the binary and (ii) the likely circumbinary environment, so that the merger – if and when it occurs – can be interpreted in an informed manner. Methods. We use infrared spectroscopy in the wavelength range 0.7 μm–2.5 μm, to which we fit model atmospheres to represent the individual stars. We use the binary ephemeris to determine the orbital phase at the time of observation. Results. We find that the infrared spectrum is best fitted by a single component having effective temperature 5 920 K, log [g] = 4.1 and solar metallicity, consistent with the fact that the system was observed at conjunction. Conclusions. The strength of the infrared H lines is consistent with a high value of log g, and the strength of the Ca ii triplet indicates the presence of a chromosphere, as might be expected from rapid stellar rotation. The He i absorption we observe likely arises in He excited by coronal activity in a circumstellar envelope, suggesting that the weakness of the Ca ii triplet is also likely chromospheric in origin

basic summary: V. Pavlenko et al. The UTC time of mid-observation of our spectrum (2457942.04199) was converted into the BJD(TDB) timescale using the IDL routines from Eastman et al. In the case of the Sun the line is also observed in absorp- tion; Avrett et al. Significant molec- ular features are not seen in the observed spectrum, therefore we accounted for only atomic lines from the VALD3 database (Ryabchikova et al., 2015). Middle panel: best the fit to the observed Ca ii triplet, with classical and “chromospheric” model atmo- spheres. Indeed, our fits of the theoretical spec- tra computed for log g = 4.19 and log g = 4.10 to the observed spectra are far superior. Left: dereddened IRTF spectrum of KIC 9832227, together with the fit with b = 1; the case b = 0 is also shown for comparison. Right: fit to the spectrum containing Si I lines, marked by vertical arrows; the He i line is also shown. However, we see that practically all notable lines in the near IR spectrum are well fitted with close-to-solar abundances; the likely errors do not exceed 0.3 dex. The discrepancies between computed and observed Ca ii lines strength may be explained by several factors, such as NLTE effects or a Ca deficit. 3 we show the hydrogen lines computed for the case of lower log g = 2.0. We draw particular attention to the modelling of the moder- ately strong hydrogen lines, to which our model provides a satis- factory fit.

The Ca ii triplet: evidence of a chromosphere Absorption in the Ca ii triplet (8 498.023, 8 542.091, 8 662.14Å) – by comparison with other metallic lines – is a notable feature of KIC 9832227’s spectrum (see Fig. Left: dereddened IRTF spectrum of KIC 9832227, together with the fit with b = 1; the case b = 0 is also shown for comparison.

We also note here an alternative interpretion: our classical model atmospheres were computed for Rosseland mean optical depth in the range τRoss = 10−5 – 100 but such models lead to Ca ii lines that are too strong. ⋆ E-mail:yp@mao.kiev.ua KIC 9832227 was identified by Molnar et al.

Title: MetQy – an R package to query metabolic functions of genes and genomes
Word count: 2469
Abstract: Summary: With the rapid accumulation of sequencing data from genomic and metagenomic studies, there is an acute need for better tools that facilitate their analyses against biological functions. To this end, we developed MetQy, an open–source R package designed for query–based analysis of functional units in [meta]genomes and/or sets of genes using the The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Furthermore, MetQy contains visualisation and analysis tools and facilitates KEGG’s flat file manipulation. Thus, MetQy enables better understanding of metabolic capabilities of known genomes or user–specified [meta]genomes by using the available information and can help guide studies in microbial ecology, metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.  Availability and Implementation: The MetQy R package is freely available and can be downloaded from our group’s website (http://osslab.lifesci.warwick.ac.uk) or GitHub (https://github.com/OSS-Lab/MetQy)

(B) A sunburst diagram showing the mcf of different modules and their functional classes as obtained from the analysis of a specific genome (genome ID: T04272). This category–based visualisation can be used to plot the standard deviation for each module’s mcf or the mean Euclidean distance (see the analysis description above for more details). 2 Software Features MetQy contains three main groups of software functions: data query, parsing, and analysis and visualisation. (A) Heatmap representation of module fraction completeness (mcf ) across selected genomes (y–axis) and modules (x–axis).

sim_matrix summary: This example demonstrates how MetQy can be used to retrieve KEGG genome data and how the metabolic functions of the extracted/matched organisms can be queried/identified in terms of KEGG modules. Users with a paid KEGG subscription can use MetQy parsing functions to update the data that the package uses. The MetQy parsing functions allow the production of the updated data, by formatting the relevant KEGG data files into R structures. They can also be used as stand–alone functions to introduce KEGG data into the R environment. Users without FTP access can analyse the KEGG genome, module and ortholog databases indirectly by using this family of functions on built–in formatted KEGG data which is not directly accessible by the user.

text_rank summary: While this example highlights how specific MetQy functions can be utilised on their own to develop a specific analysis pipeline, it is also possible to use MetQy functions to perform an automated analysis on a set of genomes grouped by genus (or another grouping factor provided by the user, e.g.To this end, we developed MetQy, an open–source R package designed for query–based analysis of functional units in [meta]genomes and/or sets of genes using the The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG).In the presented example, we evaluate the module completeness fraction (mcf ) in methanogen genomes, focusing on sample KEGG modules loosely relating to the anaerobic digestion process (note that any user specified modules, or all KEGG can be used in a real analysis).Finally, as EC numbers are widely used in systems biology, we used the KEGG orthology to translate the K number–based module definitions to EC number–based module definitions.3 Uses and applications MetQy facilitates the general usability of the KEGG database and allows users to gain qualitative information about the functional capacity of a given organism or gene set.

frequency summary: These analyses comprise of: 1) reporting the number of genomes (data sets) and modules analysed, producing a 2) heatmap of themcf of all genomes and modules analysed, 3) a boxplot of the mcf across all genomes for each module, 4) a scatter plot of the standard deviation of the mcf across all genomes for each module, 5) identifying any modules that have a constant (zero- variance) mcf across all genomes and producing a table. In addition, the function performs, for every factor group specified, the following analyses: 6) group the genomes according to that factor and create a heatmap of the mean mcf for each module across the genomes that make up each group, 7) carry out a PCA analysis on all the mcf data, showing the cumulative variance and generating a PC plot, 8) visualise the PC plot with an overlay of the factor grouping, and, finally, 9) measure the within-group (per factor) variance, using the mean Euclidean distance as a proxy for spread. While this example highlights how specific MetQy functions can be utilised on their own to develop a specific analysis pipeline, it is also possible to use MetQy functions to perform an automated analysis on a set of genomes grouped by genus (or another grouping factor provided by the user, e.g. Additionally, these functions feature optional arguments that allow users to provide up–to–date data (by using the parsing functions on KEGG FTP data) or their own data structures, such as custom–made KEGG–style modules. 2.3 Analysis and visualisation The analysis and visualisation family of functions are designed to facilitate the analysis primarily of the output of the query_genomes_to_modules function, which generates a matrix of mcf values for the genomes and modules analysed.

Title: Computer modelling of hafnium doping in lithium niobate
Word count: 2118
Abstract: Lithium niobate, LiNbO3, is an important technological material with good electro-optic, acousto-optic, elasto-optic, piezoelectric and nonlinear properties. Doping LiNbO3 with hafnium, Hf has been shown to improve the resistance of the material to optical damage. Computer modelling provides a useful means of determining the properties of doped and undoped LiNbO3, including its defect chemistry, and the effect of doping on the structure. In this paper, Hf doped LiNbO3 has been modelled, and the final defect configurations are found to be consistent with experimental results
basic similarity: 0.5955483002806872
basic summary: Interatomic Potentials In this paper use has been made of a previously derived potential for LiNbO3 , and a potential fitted to the structure of HfO2. Much useful information about lithium niobate and its defect properties can be obtained by computer modelling, based on the description of interactions between ions by effective potentials. Computer modelling provides a useful means of determining the properties of doped and undoped LiNbO3, including its defect chemistry, and the effect of doping on the structure. Future calculations will be carried out which will model the effect of Hf concentration on the preferred dopant sites, enabling comparison with these results to be made.

Title: Management services and supporting the board
Word count: 2583
Abstract: There are steps that directors and boards can take to ensure that those who support them are themselves supported and enabled to obtain access to the information and papers they need to fulfil their responsibilities, avoid conflicts of interest and provide independent and objective advice. This article considers factors that senior executives and audit, legal, governance, risk, compliance and other management services professionals should consider when making the transition on a whole or part-time basis from supporting management and improving performance to supporting the board and providing assurance.

basic summary: Ensuring Relevance Individual compliance, environmental, governance, finance, legal, risk, internal audit and other professionals with a corporate wide remit and assurance role will often focus upon particular areas. The heads of certain support functions should have a direct right of access to the independent or non-executive members of a committee or board without management colleagues being present. Escalation routes to a committee or board chairman may be required, as concerns could relate to top management or a chief executive officer. This could be achieved by mapping processes, identifying factors that either deliver or could frustrate the delivery of key board and corporate objectives, and ensuring they are covered. Those who are engaged in assurance activities on behalf of a board and advising and supporting it are often professionals with their own codes of practice and standards.

Title: Characterisation of the Clothespin relocation task as a functional assessment tool
Word count: 4056
Abstract: Method:	 The Clothespin Relocation Task has been adapted from an arm training tool to create an instrument to measure hand function.  It is based in the time to move three clothespins from a horizontal to a vertical bar, and back.    To be generally useful, the measures need to have their psychometric properties investigated.  This paper measures the characteristics of an able bodied population to gain an understanding of the underlying statistical properties of the test, in order that it can then be used to compare with different subject groups.  Fifty adults (29 males, 21 females, mean age 31) were tested with five runs of three clothespins  moved up and then down.  Ten subjects returned twice more to observe repeatability.    Results: There was a non-Gaussian range of times, from 2.5s to 7.37s.  Mean time for Up was 4.1s, and was 4.0s for Down, with a skew towards the faster times of 0.57 for Up and 0.97 for Down.  Over the three sessions there was a small (not significant) increase in speed 4.1+/-0.5s first run Down to 3.5 +/-0.4s for third.  Conclusion: These initial tests confirm that it has potential to be used as a measurement of the performance of arm movement

Clothespin Relocation Test The Clothespin Relocation Test (CRT) is an established tool for training upper limb dexterity. Similarly to the times to move the pins Up there is an upper limit for the times and longer distribution of the slower times. When a modified version of the CRT, (with a standardised pin order for motion analysis), was used with four prosthesis users the times were longer than the unaffected users.

Its distribution is non Gaussian with a skew towards the lower times for able bodied subject using their dominant hand. The results suggests that it can be used as a test, repeated over time to monitor changes in performance or for comparisons of prosthesis design including control strategies. Measurement is the time to move 3 red clothespins from 3 positions (top, middle, bottom) on the vertical bar to anywhere on the middle horizontal bar. Measurement is the time to move 3 red clothespins from 3 positions (left, middle, right) on the middle/medium horizontal bar to anywhere on the vertical bar.

Title: New development: 4P recommendations for implementing change, from research in hospitals
Word count: 3535
Abstract: How are hospital staff involved in process improvement initiatives such as Lean? What can we learn from Lean implementation experiences about the sustainability of such initiatives? The authors considered such questions in a study of workplace change in Australia and Canada. They found that Lean is more likely to be sustained when leaders adopted the 4P recommendations presented in this article
basic similarity: 0.2508744506855707
basic summary: All staff need to understand how Lean and quality improvement fit the organizational strategy, and understand their specific role in continuous improvement. Berwick stresses the need for hospital managers to trust hospital staff to ‘become citizens in the improvement of their own work’ (Berwick, 2003, p. 449). This is consistent with earlier research suggesting that health professionals sustain practices that make sense to them, make their work easier and/or improve patient care (Timmons et al., 2014). Widely communicated on how the organization will achieve high- quality care through continuous improvement at points of care.

Title: A visual exploration of melodic relationships within traditional music collections
Word count: 3791
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to discuss a technique for visually exploring melodic relationships within traditional tune collections encoded in abc notation, a widely used text-based music representation system particularly popular for folk and traditional music. There are approximately ½ million melodies encoded in abc on the web and abcnotation.com provides a searchable index of the entire corpus with tools to view, download and listen to the scores.   This paper stems from related work known as TuneGraph which uses a melodic similarity measure to derive a proximity graph representing relationships between tunes in the abc corpus, and which allows users of abcnotation.com to explore melodic similarity. As it stands TuneGraph only gives a localised view of the melodic relationships: this paper aims to look at exploring those relationships at a global (corpus-based) level via a prototype visualisation tool. Currently the tool is not interactive: in this paper the aim is to consider a proof-of-concept approach to explore where there is a useful visualisation possible; future work will look at user interactivity with the tool

basic summary: The corpus graph G(V, E) is constructed as discussed, with edges in E only included between pairs of vertices if the corresponding tunes are sufficiently similar. This restricted graph is referred to henceforth as the corpus graph, (also referred to as the fundamental proximity graph in ). In this graph each vertex represents a tune and edge weights represent similarities between tunes: the greater the similarity the larger the edge weight. In the sparse proximity graph is sparsified further and processed to produce a collection of local tune graphs, one for each connected vertex in the graph. TuneGraph uses a similarity measure to derive a proximity graph representing similarities within the abc notation corpus (~½ million tunes) which backs the search engine.

Specifically an  edge between vertices Vx and Vy is only included if   S(X,Y) ≥ average(length(X), length(Y)) * T  Following [1] values for T in the experiments are 1/4, 1/6 and  1/8; the former value considerably restricts the number of edges  whilst the latter is fairly inclusive and can allow a lot of false  positive matches.

Unfortunately, in the context of a proximity graph, such a  scheme potentially discards a lot of valuable information:  although two vertices may not be connected because the  corresponding tunes are not sufficiently similar, nonetheless it is  possible to measure the similarity between them and use that to  inform the visualisation.

Title: Sustainable supply and demand chain integration within global manufacturing industries
Word count: 3397
Abstract: Given the emerging industrial management strategies considering three pillars of sustainability in particular, there is a vital need to determine the differences of sustainability practices within both supply and demand distribution systems through global manufacturing environments providing with the successful global trade and logistics. This research paper aims to explore the interactions and advantages of sustainability applications within both supply and demand chain management. The research framework adopted consists of survey questionnaire method which is conducted within a global tyre manufacturing company. The research results and analysis justify the need for the application of ethical codes, supply chain transformation and the effective association of industry executives, professional bodies and the government. The research study also identifies that the vital incentive factors for the organisation towards sustainable supply demand chain (SSDC) are mostly the financial benefits of doing so and therefore, a positive mind-set shift towards greening practices is required

Title: A novel method to determine dynamic temperature trends applied to in-shoe temperature data during walking
Word count: 2663
Abstract: Body temperature is one of the fundamental measures considered in the assessment of health and wellbeing, with various medical conditions known to give rise to abnormal changes in temperature.   In particular, abnormal variations in dynamic temperature patterns during walking or exercise may be linked to a range of foot problems, which are of particular concern in diabetic patients.  A number of studies have investigated normative temperature patterns of a population by considering data from multiple participants and averaging results after an acclimatisation interval. In this work we demonstrate that the temperature patterns obtained using such an approach may not be truly representative of temperature changes in a population, and the averaging process adopted may yield skewed results.  In this work we propose an alternative approach to determine generic reference temperature patterns based on a minimization of root mean square differences between time-shifted versions of temperature data collected from multiple participants. The results obtained indicate that this approach can yield a general trend that is more representative of actual temperature changes across a population than conventional averaging methods. The method we propose is also shown to better capture and link the effects of underlying factors that influence dynamic temperature trends, which could in turn lead to a better understanding of underlying physiological phenomena

basic summary: 2 shows the original temperature data for male and female participants together with the overall average and standard deviation using the standard averaging approach typically adopted in the literature. The RMSD approach proposed above was tested on in- shoe temperature measurements and the results obtained were compared to those from conventional temperature trends obtained by simple averaging procedures. Using the proposed method, all of the data captured is plotted with time, thus all of the different aspects of the data can be characterised using one model. CONCLUSION Temperature changes for medical investigations are typically conducted by computing the mean of the number of data sessions captured over the particular time period. considered the mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values in their investigation of the effect of ambient temperature and age on foot temperature. The acquired temperature data is averaged and the mean value with time, together with maximum and minimum or standard deviation are determined. The mean and standard deviation of the acquired data across participants are then used to characterize normal temperature values.

In this work we propose an alternative approach to determine generic reference temperature patterns based on a minimization of root mean square differences between time- shifted versions of temperature data collected from multiple participants.

frequency summary: Using the proposed method,  all of the data captured from the different subjects or sources  can be considered from one plot as well as its different trends  which could be due to the different source from where the  data is being captured. This proposed approach of applying the RMSD to a set of  captured data and then plotting the matched trends could be  applied to any data captured from different subjects or  scenarios over a period of time. Therefore, in plotting data with time using the method  proposed in this paper, one would be obtaining a more  informative pattern than when plotting data using the  conventional mean approach. Using the proposed method, all of the  data captured is plotted with time, thus all of the different  aspects of the data can be characterised using one model.

Title: Non-human gaming
Word count: 543
Abstract: In this talk, I will critically analyse the rise of video games that require limited human intervention to be played. Idle games such as Cookie Clicker and Adventure Capitalist, games made by algorithms such as No Man’s Sky, the programming of AI to play games such as Screeps, Drivatars and ghost cars in racing games, all suggest that human beings are becoming peripheral in the act of playing and in the definition of video games. Drawing on Sonia Fizek’s analysis of Slavoj Zizek and Robert Pfaller’s concept of interpassivity, and on studies on gamification and self-tracking, I will argue that Non-Human Gaming is not necessarily an exception to oppose to ‘standard’ video games, or a temporary trend. I will argue that the non-human has always been haunting the medium, and that studies on interactivity, agency, and player’s competences have been providing, so far, a comforting perspective that places the human at the centre. In fact, Non-Human Gaming is an adequate response to the disappearance of life from Earth – as it has been imagined, feared, and prophesised by scientists in the last few decades. Alexander Galloway’s concept of video games as allegories of life will be deployed to argue that digital games are transforming into living things, which could entirely replace human players and play by themselves. From this perspective, video games might be seen in relation to the rise of self-driving cars, algorithmic trade exchange, and remote warfare, which could be functioning by themselves after human extinction. Roger Caillois, in his early work on mimicry and mythology, was already prefiguring a similar hypothesis: living beings develop forms of dispersal and waste of energy (of which games are an example) that cannot be explained through a rationalistic view on evolution and species preservation, but are nonetheless defining characteristics of life

Title: Reasoning and learning services for coalition situational understanding
Word count: 3947
Abstract: Situational understanding requires an ability to assess the current situation and anticipate future situations, requiring both pattern recognition and inference. A coalition involves multiple agencies sharing information and analytics. This paper considers how to harness distributed information sources, including multimodal sensors, together with machine learning and reasoning services, to perform situational understanding in a coalition context. To exemplify the approach we focus on a technology integration experiment in which multimodal data — including video and still imagery, geospatial and weather data — is processed and fused in a service-oriented architecture by heterogeneous pattern recognition and inference components. We show how the architecture: (i) provides awareness of the current situation and prediction of future states, (ii) is robust to individual service failure, (iii) supports the generation of ‘why’ explanations for human analysts (including from components based on ‘black box’ deep neural networks which pose particular challenges to explanation generation), and (iv) allows for the imposition of information sharing constraints in a coalition context where there is varying levels of trust between partner agencies

basic summary: Once these services are made available to the system, the system itself can autonomously make a decision as to which model is most appropriate. This paper considers how to harness distributed information sources, including multimodal sensors, together with machine learning and reasoning services, to perform situational understanding in a coalition context. 4.2 Congestion Reasoner As shown in Figure 3, the congestion reasoner involves an integration of multiple services and data sources. In our instantiated system, this occurs between the congestion classifier model and the congestion reasoner service. Dark grey arrows show information flow leading to predicted road speed; light grey arrows show information flow to generate explanations for predictions 6.

sim_matrix summary: DETECTING CURRENT CONGESTION USING AN INTERPRETABLE DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM For our congestion detection work we implemented an instantiation of a conceptual system architecture intro- duced in.5 The structure of the system is shown in Figure 2. 6.3 Operating Under Coalition Information Flow Constraints When building a system that takes advantage of data sources and services across a coalition, there are a number of information flow constraints that must be factored in. Sections 4 and 5 give a summary of two pieces of previous work in the domain of traffic congestion detection that, taken together, offer a coalition system for the detection of current traffic congestion (insight) and models for the prediction of future congestion (foresight) respectively. Furthermore, as we ensured that the system architecture we developed remained decoupled from the specific problem, our final system can be used as a template for approaching other CSU problems by simply exchanging the data sources and services related to the congestion space to ones relevant to alternative CSU problems. In our system, the object detector used in this interpretability technique already existed within our coalition of services as it was created as part of the congestion reasoner service chain.
