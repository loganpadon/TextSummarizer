Word count: 1695
Abstract: Through the story of Chol, LSE’s Naomi Pendle explores the meaning of exile and the lived experience of being a refugee through cycles of displacement and return. In the first article of this two-part series, Pendle tells us how Chol rebuilt home after years spent in exile. Now, LSE’s Naomi Pendle narrates Chol’s return into exile, a journey that was in itself a return and cemented his ability to build a family

basic summary: Now, LSE’s Naomi Pendle narrates Chol’s return into exile, a journey that was in itself a return and cemented his ability to build a family. It was these networks, as much as a journey to a safe space, that he sought to cement as safety for himself, his wife and his son. Yet, they knew that the journey would be fraught with dangers and force them to weave between government and rebel held territories.

sim_matrix summary: Safety for Chol was the return to northern Sudan and the familiar values of business. He feared others would advise against this journey as people had already tried to reach Khartoum and not all had been safe. Yet, they knew that the journey would be fraught with dangers and force them to weave between government and rebel held territories.

Title: Young people are highly critical of Brexit and fear the insularity it could bring
Word count: 1070
Abstract: Most young people did not support Brexit and the referendum result left many feeling frustrated and disempowered, write Shakuntala Banaji and Sam Mejias (LSE). They fear the vote will make the UK more insular and are highly critical of the way the campaign was conducted. In focus groups, they showed a strong understanding of the EU – and want a Brexit settlement that tackles inequality as well as ensuring Britain is an open and welcoming country
basic similarity: 0.32409041521935816
basic summary: A minority of respondents asserted that the referendum and subsequent events had been a ‘participation catalyst’ for young people to become more politically active. As soon as people voted leave, there were attacks on minorities…I don’t know [if] people thought it was more OK to be racist, because they were leaving [the EU]. Secondly, young people expressed dissatisfaction that the oldest generations (65+) should have such a disproportionate influence on the futures of the youngest citizens.

sim_matrix summary: With no funding, but assisted by a fantastic group of youth partners (including youth participation NGO My Life My Say and the All Party Parliamentary Group on a Better Brexit for Young People) we set up a series of focus groups across the UK to find out what young people from 13 to 30 think and feel about Brexit, and what they want out of the Brexit process. (Youth participant from Falkirk & Clackmannanshire, Scotland) Priorities and hopes It will come as no surprise then that a majority of young people in our study were adamant that they want the post- Brexit UK to be a better place than the UK is now, that they want negotiations to retain the rights and benefits associated with Europe today – freedom of movement, human and civil rights protections, subsidies, the single market – while also tackling inequality that has risen due to austerity. Although these were complex, and not a simple matter of the young ‘blaming’ everyone older than them, we were told of two levels of resentment: in the first case, young people under 18 felt deprived of a voice and overwhelmingly said that if they could, they would have voted to remain.

tfidf summary: Can’t we just stop talking about Brexit?’ Some people have simply had enough.

Title: The political significance of Poland's government reshuffle
Word count: 1984
Abstract: A sweeping reshuffle by Poland's new prime minister has changed the shape and direction of its government, with a greater emphasis being placed on economic modernisation, political stabilisation and improving EU relations. But as Aleks Szczerbiak writes, this pivot to the technocratic centre risks alienating the ruling party's core electorate, and is more about packaging the government's reforms attractively than abandoning its its radical state re-construction programme

basic summary: Most Law and Justice deputies support this, but in autumn 2016 large protests forced the ruling party to vote down a previous attempt to introduce greater restrictions. Cardiologist and deputy higher education minister Łukasz Szumowski took over as health minister from Konstanty Radziwiłł, who failed to resolve a high profile dispute involving resident doctors.

text_rank similarity: 0.3416427475717157
text_rank summary: Indeed, some commentators have suggested that the reshuffle may be part of a more ambitious, long-term project of transforming Law and Justice into a pragmatic conservative grouping; although others dismiss it as simply a tactical pivot similar to the one that the party performed so successfully in the run-up to the 2015 elections.Beata Szydło’s administration took the political flak for introducing these reforms but, with the passage of the judicial reform laws at the end of last year, many of the key elements of the government’s state re-construction programme are now in place.

Political stabilisation and improving EU relations One of the reshuffle’s main objectives was to stabilise and consolidate Law and Justice’s position ahead of a series of key elections: local government elections in autumn 2018, European Parliament elections in summer 2019, and parliamentary elections in autumn 2019, culminating in the summer 2020 presidential poll.

Title: What the 2015 Greek debt negotiations tell us about Germany's negotiating stance on Brexit
Word count: 1401
Abstract: If the UK wants to secure favourable terms during the Brexit negotiations, it will be crucial to win the support of Germany. But what are the key German priorities as the talks move on to the second phase? Luuk Molthof writes that the 2015 Greek debt negotiations offer some insights into the German approach, and that the UK is likely to be disappointed if it believes Germany will put economic interests above its political support for European integration
basic similarity: 0.46739467262411993
basic summary: To understand why the British government would do well to heed these warnings, it is useful to be reminded of Germany’s role in the 2015 Greek bailout negotiations. The reason why Germany ultimately agreed to another bailout was because a Greek exit from the eurozone would undermine the euro’s credibility as an instrument of political integration. Yet in order to protect the euro’s role as a political instrument, Germany was willing to bear the economic costs.

Similarly, Germany is likely to be willing to bear the economic costs of a no deal Brexit should that be necessary to protect the integrity of the internal market. First, Germany’s decision back then to agree to a third bailout package for Greece, despite the apparent failings of the first two packages, is indicative of Berlin’s willingness to prioritise political over economic ends.

Second, Germany’s refusal to soften Greece’s bailout conditions, even after repeated attempts by the Greek government to put pressure on Berlin, suggests that Germany is not one to soften its position at the behest of a junior negotiating partner. The British government faces a similar suboptimal outcome should it fail to come to the realisation soon that it is indeed the junior negotiating partner, that time is really not on its side, and that empty threats to walk away from the negotiations without a deal aren’t likely to change anyone’s mind, least of all Germany’s.

text_rank similarity: 0.31522305146551355
text_rank summary: Assuming the VFL bill makes it beyond the second reading, we can expect any subsequent parliamentary debate to be highly politicised: opposition parties see VFL not as a progressive move to end the disenfranchisement of potentially millions of its citizens living outside the UK, but as a cynical ploy to increase Tory votes and donations (individuals can only donate if they are on an electoral register).This is further corroborated by the simultaneous statement from the Chair of ‘Conservatives Abroad’, Heather Harper, who welcomed the government’s renewed commitment to VFL: “The second reading of [the Overseas Electors Bill] brings us closer to getting votes for life for all British expatriates”.Certain campaigners have suggested that the creation of dedicated ‘overseas’ constituencies, such as those created by France, Italy, and Portugal, would avoid the problems of establishing proof of previous registration or residence, and would give expats better representation.

Peter van den Besselaar and Ulf Sandström have studied a large sample of researchers and found that, while results vary by field, there is a positive and stronger than linear relationship between productivity and quality (in terms of the top cited papers). This same pattern appears to apply to institutions as well as individual researchers

basic summary: Figure 3: Relationship between number of papers per university and impact in terms of Top10% papers. For each researcher we calculated the (field-normalised and fractionally counted) total number of publications and also the number of those publications that figure in the (2.5%) highest cited papers. In the social sciences, the (slightly) “diminishing returns” pattern seems to dominate; whereas the “impact ceiling” pattern was found for computer science & mathematics and for the humanities. Higher numbers of papers do result in even higher numbers of top cited papers.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.5156065182243281
sim_matrix summary: Figure 1 shows the various possible relationships between “quality” and “quantity” that may exist: (i) there may be an “impact ceiling”, meaning that after a certain number of papers the number of highly cited papers stabilises; there could be (ii) diminishing; (iii) constant; or even (iv) increasing “impact returns” from productivity; and finally (v) “small may be beautiful” in the sense that the number of high-impact papers decreases when authors become too productive, trading quality for quantity. Our understanding, developed in a recent PLoS ONE paper, is that there is a positive and stronger than linear relationship between productivity and quality (in terms of the top cited papers). We tested this using the Leiden Ranking 2014, which details the number of papers and the number of papers belonging to the top 10% highly cited papers for all universities included. This size effect also holds at organisational level, something we did not address in the PLoS ONE paper but tested after a reviewer claimed the opposite: “the CWTS Leiden Ranking, for example, does not show such a linear relationship as the authors claim between the number of papers produced by a university and the percentage of highly cited papers produced by that university”.

Title: Far right politics in Germany: from fascism to populism?
Word count: 1533
Abstract: The rise of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) was one of the major stories of the 2017 German elections. As Tomá\v Nociar and Jan Philipp Thomeczek write, there has been a tendency among some commentators to draw parallels between the AfD and extremist or fascist parties from Germany's past. They argue that this is both unhelpful and inaccurate, and that the AfD has far more in common with other ‘populist’ parties who have had success in recent European elections
basic similarity: 0.3153863617359825
basic summary: This new type of populist radical right party either never developed or dropped the antidemocratic sentiment in favour of a populist critique of the establishment. It is the rise of a populist radical right that is successful precisely because of its populism and not because it embodies fascism or extremism. There is a current, often criticised trend to use the term populism to describe contemporary far right politics.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.4789994534256334
sim_matrix summary: The case of Germany: Why the AfD succeeds where the NPD failed The difference between the traditional extreme right and the contemporary populist radical right can best be exemplified when looking at the history and ideology of two far right parties in Germany: the National Democratic Party (NPD), founded in 1964, and the Alternative for Germany (AfD), founded in 2013. It is the rise of a populist radical right that is successful precisely because of its populism and not because it embodies fascism or extremism. Several authors point out that it is precisely populism that distinguishes the traditional post-war antidemocratic extreme right, which was inspired by interwar fascist movements, from the modern populist far right parties.

Regarding international cooperation, the NPD allies itself with other extremist parties and is a member of the Alliance for Peace and Freedom along with parties such as Greece’s Golden Dawn or Kotleba – People’s Party Our Slovakia, the only two truly extreme right parties with seats in national parliaments of EU member states. In the following period, the emphasis on national/nationalist discourse (“Germany”, “Germans”, “Volk”) became stronger.

Title: LSE festival Beveridge 2.0 preview: 'why we need a citizen's basic income: a new edition or a new book?' by Malcolm Torry
Word count: 1430
Abstract: On Tuesday 20 February 2018, LSE hosted a ‘Citizen’s Basic Income Day’, including the LSE Festival evening event, ‘Beveridge Rebooted: A Basic Income for Every Citizen?’: listen to the podcast here. Ahead of the discussion, panellist Dr Malcolm Torry discusses his forthcoming new book on the topic, Why We Need a Citizen’s Basic Income, and how it builds on his previous works, including Money for Everyone: Why We Need a Citizen’s Income
basic similarity: 0.19469162526389894
basic summary: Everyone of the same age would receive the same amount, every week or every month, no matter what their income, wealth, employment status, household structure, etc. We decided to put detailed research results in an online appendix because we believed that the figures would go out of date much faster than the book.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.4298109532849054
sim_matrix summary: A Citizen’s Basic Income (sometimes called a Basic Income, a Citizen’s Income or a Universal Basic Income) is an unconditional and nonwithdrawable income for every individual. The final two chapters were about alternatives to Citizen’s Basic Income, and about the social problems that a Citizen’s Basic Income would not solve.
text_rank similarity: 0.3417048634897042
text_rank summary: A brief flurry of activity 35 years ago prompted a small group of us to form the Basic Income Research Group – now the Citizen’s Basic Income Trust – and then the Basic Income European Network (BIEN: now the Basic Income Earth Network) to promote research and debate, so that the idea wouldn’t disappear entirely, and so that the next time there was an upswing in interest, there would be expertise and literature available to facilitate an intelligent discussion.By 2016 the question ‘would a Citizen’s Basic Income be a good idea?’ was still being asked, but two other questions were if anything more prominent: would a Citizen’s Basic Income be feasible?
tfidf similarity: 0.391071107287548
tfidf summary: In the evening, Professors Philippe Van Parijs and John Kay will debate the motion: ‘This house believes that if the Beveridge Report were being written today then it would have recommended a Basic Income’. A Citizen’s Basic Income (sometimes called a Basic Income, a Citizen’s Income or a Universal Basic Income) is an unconditional and nonwithdrawable income for every individual.

The answer to that question might, of course, be different from the answer to the question: ‘do we need a Citizen’s Basic Income?’ Dr. Malcolm Torry has been Director of the Citizen’s Basic Income Trust since 2001 (and was Director before that between 1988 and 1992); he is a Visiting Senior Fellow in the Social Policy Department at LSE; and he is General Manager of BIEN, The Basic Income Earth Network.

Title: Who is helped by Help to Buy?
Word count: 1831
Abstract: What's not to like about a policy which can expand home ownership and boost the supply of housing? Geoff Meeks and J.Gay Meeks recount some of the doubts about the efficacy of the government's Help to Buy scheme. They present new evidence on some of its regressive distributional consequences, and touch on the opportunity cost of the subsidy programme
basic similarity: 0.407356173557794
basic summary: These are “equity loans”, which means the government’s stake in a participating house changes at the same rate with the value of the house. As house prices rise, the argument goes, the government achieves capital gains, which offset the interest costs of servicing the debt which funds H2B. So the new house will be much the better buy, and it will be worth her while to pay more for the new than for the second- hand house.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.42080610435706217
sim_matrix summary: One consequence of the H2B subsidy further stoking the inflation of house prices is that the initial aim of the scheme is subverted: renters who can’t take advantage of the H2B subsidy are left further behind. Table 1 shows the total H2B loans extended by the government nationally in each year since 2013; and the builders’ average profit margin and return on equity for two years before and each year after H2B began. As it is only available for new homes, a Londoner faced with the choice between a new house costing £550k and an identical second-hand house at the same price can get an H2B subsidy of around £7k a year (the interest saved) if she opts for the new house.
text_rank similarity: 0.39348369546530537
text_rank summary: But similarly, if house prices fall, then the Exchequer will be faced not just with the interest bill but also with a capital loss impairing the public sector balance sheet: the total cost of H2B will be higher still.One report suggests that H2B has allowed builders to raise selling prices by towards 10%.So on top of the pressure from existing home-owners not to suffer falls in the value of their homes, and from house- builders anxious to keep the party going, H2B creates another political imperative to keep the bubble inflating – avoiding impairment of the government’s H2B loans.
tfidf similarity: 0.4485068566920345
tfidf summary: Another is that part of the benefit of the subsidy is appropriated by the builders. So the new house will be much the better buy, and it will be worth her while to pay more for the new than for the second- hand house. Again we have analysed the information provided by companies’ annual reports on executives’ incomes and gains before and after the introduction of H2B.

Title: El Salvador's experience of UN peacebuilding reveals the ineffectiveness of 'development as usual' approaches
Word count: 1156
Abstract: To provide the vital "peace dividend" of better lives and livelihoods, peacebuilding must promote conflict-sensitive policies even where they are economically second-best. The UN can support this process by helping states in transition to reactivate their economies in an inclusive and sustainable manner, writes Graciana del Castillo (City University of New York)
basic similarity: 0.14508820495757624
basic summary: And even those that achieved a tenuous peace ended up highly aid dependent, often even for basic food needs. Lacking support, former combatants had to abandon programmes like arms-for-land that had given them a stake, however small, in the peace process.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.2564239677274669
sim_matrix summary: With the country at the brink of war only nine months after the peace agreement of January 1992, El Salvador provided early evidence of many of obstacles to peacebuilding that would later plague transitions to peace elsewhere in the world. The path to peace dividends With El Salvador now considered by most accounts a failed state, the lesson for the UN, as well as for Colombia and other countries undergoing transitions to peace, is that economic reconstruction of war-torn societies is not “development as usual”.
text_rank similarity: 0.23227203707328817
text_rank summary: Essentially, El Salvador showed that when economic reconstruction took place alongside efforts at national reconciliation and major reforms to politics and security, it was fundamentally different from “development as usual”.This two-way relationship between security and economy – often neglected by the UN in favour of a greater focus on human rights, elections, and gender issues – has proved to be a major obstacle to successful and sustainable transitions to peace, stability, and improved welfare.

Emily Holland and Hadas Aron react to this claim, most notably asserted in Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt's new book, 'How Democracies Die,' noting that the decline of one of the most stable, long-lasting democracies in the world can only be compared to the decline of other lasting, consolidated democracies, of which there are none

Title: The hidden costs of research assessment exercises: the curious case of Australia
Word count: 1309
Abstract: Research assessment exercises provide the government and wider public with assurance of the quality of university research, with the guiding principles being accountability, transparency, and openness. But is there the same accountability and openness when it comes to the public cost of these large-scale exercises? Ksenia Sawczak examines the situation in Australia as the research sector looks ahead to the new Engagement and Impact Assessment later this year. There seems little doubt this exercise will demand significant resources, with no guarantee it will achieve its stated goal of improving how universities engage with industry. Until the hidden costs of assessment exercises are revealed and a thorough consideration of their general utility is undertaken, questions will remain as to whether they are a responsible use of public monies

basic summary: There seems little doubt this exercise will demand significant resources, with no guarantee it will achieve its stated goal of improving how universities engage with industry. What is curious about Australia is that ERA functions in a vacuum, conducted by government but playing no role in informing federal research policy or funding allocations to universities. The authors of the NISA boldly stated that an exercise of this kind will ultimately lead to improvements in how universities engage with industry. Ksenia Sawczak examines the situation in Australia as the research sector looks ahead to the new Engagement and Impact Assessment later this year. About the author Ksenia Sawczak is Director of Research Services at the University of Canberra, where she oversees the preparation of data submissions to government agencies.

sim_matrix summary: But for an exercise so firmly grounded in principles of accountability, transparency, and openness with the public – something particularly evident in prefaces to the National Reports the ARC releases after each ERA, which strongly emphasise the importance of assuring the public of the value of government investment in research – the missing element is the public cost of such an endeavour. To further complicate matters, the ARC has decided to follow in the footsteps of the UK’s Research Evaluation Framework by conducting a new assessment exercise this year – the Engagement and Impact Assessment. Across Australia, universities are in the throes of pulling together submissions to Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA) – the comprehensive assessment exercise, overseen by the Australian Research Council (ARC), which serves as a stocktake of all research conducted in Australian universities. For some time, the Australian government has been strongly concerned about the benefits of university-generated research beyond academia, leading to this new assessment exercise being announced as part of its 2015 National Innovation and Science Agenda. Until the hidden costs of assessment exercises in Australia are revealed and a thorough consideration of their general utility is undertaken, they will remain an international curiosity, with the dubious honour of serving as an example of assessment for the sake of assessment and irresponsible use of public monies.

In spite of this and the many other concerns raised by universities about the burden associated with a new exercise, the Engagement and Impact Assessment is well and truly underway. Everyone knows them, and they are also the tool most Australian universities now use to set targets for performance and monitor their own achievements. 2018 marks the fourth running of this gigantic exercise since its introduction in 2010, and the high frequency of the exercise means universities are now well-accustomed to the never-ending cycle of submissions, with preparations for a new round commencing as soon as the previous one ends.

Apart from ERA, Australian universities undertake a multitude of other regular reporting to government in research-related areas, such as the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ Survey of Research and Experimental Development and the Department of Innovation’s National Survey of Research Commercialisation, although the submission data is not subject to evaluation. To further complicate matters, the ARC has decided to follow in the footsteps of the UK’s Research Evaluation Framework by conducting a new assessment exercise this year – the Engagement and Impact Assessment.

Title: Looming REF deadlines lead to a rush in publication of lower quality research
Word count: 1280
Abstract: The increased significance of research assessments and their implications for funding and career prospects has had a knock-on effect on academic publication patterns. Moqi Groen-Xu, Pedro A. Teixeira, Thomas Voigt and Bernhard Knapp report on research that reveals a marked increase in research productivity immediately prior to an evaluation deadline, which quickly reverses once the deadline has passed. Moreoever, the quality of papers published just before deadlines is lower, as measured by citations. Those who design research assessments should consider having cycles of varying lengths across different fields, affording researchers the time and opportunity to pursue more novel, risky projects

basic summary: Our research indicates that research output does indeed change around the time researchers are submitted to assessment exercises. Those who design research assessments should consider having cycles of varying lengths across different fields, affording researchers the time and opportunity to pursue more novel, risky projects. After our research was reported on the Times Higher Education, Steven Hill – Head of Research Policy at HEFCE – raised concerns about our interpretation of the findings. Because older papers had more time to accumulate citations, information about them is more precise at that time, thus biasing the choice of older articles with higher citation counts.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.38216974100200446
sim_matrix summary: The variance in journal impact factor is higher for papers published just after the deadline, indicating that researchers did not just time their publications accordingly but possibly also pursued more novel and uncertain research projects when further from the deadline. Our research indicates that research output does indeed change around the time researchers are submitted to assessment exercises. This should allow departments with longer research cycles to pursue a more important research agenda. However, we actually observe a higher variance of quality in research published further from the deadline.

Title: The UK government is shedding some of its illusions about Brexit, and softening its position
Word count: 1040
Abstract: Step by step, the UK government is shedding some of its illusions about Brexit, argues Holger Schmieding (Berenberg). The United Kingdom has already accepted that it will have to meet the legally binding financial commitments it incurred while it was a member of the European Union (the so-called Brexit bill) and is going along with the EU's timetable for negotiations (divorce issues first, transition deal next, outlines of a future trade deal last). Last Friday saw another set of concessions being made by the Prime Minister
basic similarity: 0.29300883254900806
basic summary: Under such a deal, the UK would maintain access to the EU’s single market for goods and for some services on almost the same preferential terms as before. The only practical way in which Brexit could be reversed would be if early new elections swept a Labour-led government to power that might possibly call a new referendum. However, Theresa May is not yet close to such a deal that would minimise the economic damage to the UK.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.4964065301226049
sim_matrix summary: The only way to draw hope from the Mansion House speech is to view it as just one of many steps on the long road from British Brexit illusions to an acceptance of reality: the UK government can either insist on its positions and suffer a hard Brexit without a significant deal with the EU or accept the terms for a preferential market access agreement that the EU can offer – or possibly reconsider Brexit once it has become fully clear what Brexit will entail in practice. If Theresa May continues to ditch one illusion after the other, making the UK position progressively more realistic without shattering her fractious government in the process, the UK may still end up with the semi-soft or soft Brexit that minimises the economic damage for the UK. As a result, any deal will reflect the bargaining position of the EU much more than the wishes of the UK government.

Third, as Ireland is the EU27 country most affected by Brexit, the EU has de facto granted Ireland a veto over the terms of any deal on post-Brexit relations which the EU27 can strike with the UK. On the most fundamental level, May does not yet seem to acknowledge three key facts: First, the medium-sized UK earns 12 per cent of its GDP through exports to the EU27 whereas the EU27 send exports worth merely 3 per cent of their GDP to the UK.

In her speech at Mansion House last Friday, Prime Minister Theresa May went one step further, acknowledging that the UK has to face “hard facts” on Brexit and that “life is going to be different after Brexit”. If we extrapolate the British learning curve into the future, reason may still prevail in the end with an agreement on a “soft” or “semi-soft” Brexit by October 2018, in time for both sides to ratify it before the UK formally leaves the EU on 29 March 2019.

A new partnership body, Productivity UK, should also be established with the goal of raising firm-level productivity, including the acceleration of investment in automation technologies. Whereas past waves of automation typically required machines to have a clear set of instructions in structured environments to enable them to perform tasks once done by humans, today’s machines can act without explicit instruction in complex environments.

Abstract: How does it feel to be a Polish national in Scotland after the EU referendum? Kate Botterill (Edinburgh Napier University) discusses how the result and subsequent uncertainty affected them, and the strategies they have adopted to deal with it. Post-Brexit, the Scottish Government want a different approach to migration from the rest of the UK, which may lead to stronger identification with Scotland among many Poles living in the country. Nonetheless, Scottish public attitudes towards migration appear to be hardening

Given these challenges, will changing Scotland’s narrative on migration be enough to make EU citizens feel at home? This research raises key questions about how Polish nationals are negotiating belonging in Scotland through broader affiliations with Europe, and often away from Poland. When it comes to migration, Scotland is widely considered to be on a different political journey to the rest of the UK.

She reveals that despite acquiring formal citizenship and feeling ‘welcome’ in Scotland, the anti-migration discourse in the UK continues to shape her everyday encounters and sense of security and belonging.

Title: The crisis in social care is connected to the gendered inadequacy of labour law
Word count: 1218
Abstract: Lydia Hayes writes that social care is a feminist issue. Highlighting some of the appalling conditions that care workers tolerate, she explains how employment law fails to protect women's employment and to value feminised labour. She concludes that unless social care provision is revolutionised, women will have little choice but to serve as unpaid carers: stuck at home, excluded from public life, and denied life choices
basic similarity: 0.22275951470506908
basic summary: Until the wages of care workers are free from sexist devaluation, and until the work of care workers is fully recognised, the labour of all women is devalued. The inadequacy of minimum wage law The financial crisis of 2007/2008 heralded UK labour market changes in which care work became the largest source of low-waged work for women. Care workers are failed by the current right to a minimum wage where their work is not recognised as ‘work’ for the purposes of statutory pay protection.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.33128680985286757
sim_matrix summary: When the social care minimum wage scandal of 2017 highlighted that thousands of care workers were paid nothing more than pocket-money to ensure the overnight well-being of vulnerable adults, employers were outraged that they should have to pay care workers what was legally owed. Until the wages of care workers are free from sexist devaluation, and until the work of care workers is fully recognised, the labour of all women is devalued. If we continue to tolerate care workers being employed to work without pay, the future of care work will be based on sexist expectations that care work should be done for free.
text_rank similarity: 0.2660912497754552
text_rank summary: Although the right to a minimum wage was supposed to prevent exploitation, it has become standard industry practice for care workers to work for free during increasingly large parts of each working day.A sex- based ideology about women’s subservience to the needs of others still circulates in the contemporary labour market, and minimum wage law does not do enough to assert the value of care work.If we continue to tolerate care workers being employed to work without pay, the future of care work will be based on sexist expectations that care work should be done for free.

frequency summary: Inadequacies in equal pay law perpetuate the historic subordination of women in low-waged work, prevent care workers from achieving economic independence, and exemplify the economic invisibility of skills and abilities which are thought to arise ‘naturally’ in women. Care workers are failed by the current right to a minimum wage where their work is not recognised as ‘work’ for the purposes of statutory pay protection. Where women do not work in close proximity to men, equal pay law offers very little and prevents women from comparing their wages to those of men who do not work for the same employer.

Secondly, Tamils have for aeons seen Lord Murugan as their presiding deity and the Dravidian tradition which is inspired by a Tamil sense of belonging, is inevitably a staunch pro-Murugan mission if their adherents are to believe in any god at all, for all the sites of Murugan worship are spread out on lands where Dravidian kings once conquered.

Title: High prices, not waste or over-use, drive high health care costs in the US
Word count: 881
Abstract: The US spends nearly 18 percent of its GDP on health care, making it a real outlier among high-income countries in this area. But what is behind this unusually high level of health care spending? Irene Papanicolas investigates common beliefs about why spending is so high, including that US residents use more health care services, have poorer quality of care, and use 'too much' inpatient care. She finds that higher costs in the US are largely driven by higher prices across a wide range of health care services such as surgical procedures and drugs, as well as administrative complexity and costs
basic similarity: 0.5571066253885557
basic summary: The data suggest two main factors drive health care spending in the US: higher prices across a wide range of health care services and administrative complexity and costs. Evidence: The US has among the lowest proportion of health care spending on inpatient services (19 percent) and among the highest for outpatient services (42 percent). While low social spending may contribute to poorer population health outcomes, it is unlikely a primary driver of higher health care spending. Belief 1: The US spends more than other countries because US residents consume much more health care services.

Title: How we can preserve assisted housing in the context of gentrification and constrained federal resources
Word count: 1239
Abstract: Like many American cities, Washington DC is experiencing a squeeze in its affordable housing: population increases and declining stocks of government subsidized housing are making it harder for low-income households to find somewhere to live. In new research, Kathryn Howell looks at how existing assisted housing in Washington, DC is being preserved in the face of gentrification and funding challenges. She writes that preservation is a long and complex process that engages diverse stakeholders from tenants and tenant organizers to local and federal agency staff
basic similarity: 0.4912927530547169
basic summary: This case offers powerful support for increased collaboration between stakeholders and meaningful local laws and flexible funding for the preservation of affordable housing. But developing new funding sources and programs for the complex process of preservation requires multiple private and government stakeholders, shared governance and access to data. She writes that preservation is a long and complex process that engages diverse stakeholders from tenants and tenant organizers to local and federal agency staff.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.4140020542281627
sim_matrix summary: The DC Preservation Network is a monthly meeting of preservation stakeholders from tenant organizers to federal government staff. These stakeholders used a mix local policies, including local tenant protections, flexible funding sources such as DC’s Housing Production Trust Fund, and laws that enabled access to the housing market such as the Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act, which gives tenants the right of first refusal when their building is for sale. One example of the process for preservation and loss is Museum Square Apartments in Washington, DC.
text_rank similarity: 0.367286731061832
text_rank summary: Federal resources have declined for 40 years in the United States, leaving many cities and states, regardless of the market, at a loss to support the development and preservation of affordable housing.However, the Museum Square One case is just one example of the way affordable housing leaves the subsidized stock, as well as the efforts made by a broad group of stakeholders to try to preserve it.Many cities – like the District of Columbia – have begun to understand that production of units using federal funds only approaches a portion of the problem in the face of the growth in many US cities that has made neighbourhoods unaffordable for low- and moderate-income households.

In Washington, buildings were tracked by the preservation network for an average of 16 months before they were lost – many of those buildings had been tracked multiple times by the group, suggesting that there are clear opportunities for stakeholders to engage with the building owner, residents and funders. Because of the diverse scale impacts of affordable housing – city, neighbourhood, building and tenant – as well as the dimensions of funding, code enforcement and daily living, there must be an avenue through which data can be shared to create a more complete picture of the building’s status.

Title: Book review: colonial coptivity during the First World War: internment and the fall of the German empire, 1914-1919 by Mahon Murphy
Word count: 1221
Abstract: In Colonial Captivity during the First World War: Internment and the Fall of the German Empire, 1914-1919, Mahon Murphy offers a comprehensive study of the experiences of the 20,000 Germans in colonies who spent in time in Allied captivity during World War One. This is an impressive analysis that uses internment as a prism to examine the War’s extra-European theatres, underscoring the conflict’s global dimensions and critically examining imperial notions of race, writes Joshua Smeltzer

basic summary: Indeed, Murphy’s narrative firmly establishes an interconnected web of camps, implicated in imperial notions of race and shaped by a common European civilising mission. At the outbreak of World War One, the British swiftly repatriated Germans from Cameroon and Togo, while transferring combatants and males of military age to camps in Britain.

Title: A coercive policy-making state? How the EU is alienating its citizens
Word count: 1284
Abstract: The remit of EU institutions has expanded inexorably, writes Jeremy Richardson, all while their policy-making style has shifted from a consensus-based process towards a more coercive, top-down one. At the same time, the EU's focus on interest groups might have also exacerbated the problem of the democratic deficit by distancing the EU from broader public opinion. These realities have contributed to both Brexit and the broader 'populist revolt' across Member States

Title: Critical actors and abortion law: a group of individuals in Northern Irish politics obstructs change
Word count: 965
Abstract: There are various reasons why progress on legal abortion in Northern Ireland has been blocked over the years. Key among them is that individual politicians rule out any suggestion of change, writes Jennifer Thomson. She argues that more attention should be given to the actions of individual actors, considering their role can often be as important as that of political parties or institutions
basic similarity: 0.3653035509601473
basic summary: Feminist political scientists have long employed the concept of ‘critical actors’ to refer to key individuals who instigate positive change within political institutions. Attempts to change abortion policy at the moment are also not helped by the fact that Northern Ireland is facing one of its most challenging political periods in decades. When considering why some policies are difficult to change, or even to implement at all, consideration must be given to the actions of individual members of political institutions.

This has been the case in Northern Ireland, where a small number of critical actors have obstructed change on abortion for many years. In 2013, Paul Girvan DUP MLA and Alban Maginness SDLP MLA attempted to outlaw any private abortion providers in Northern Ireland which would have closed down the newly opened Marie Stopes clinic in central Belfast.

Word count: 1257
Abstract: Following on from his previous analysis on why city centrism has not turned out to be a panacea for urban development so far, Andy Pike argues it is time for fresh thinking. He explains why we need to find better ways to think about and design policies that support the combination of the dynamism of Britain's city centres

Title: In Congressional races, political networks play an important role in ensuring minority representation
Word count: 1198
Abstract: A number of retirements in Congress ahead of the 2018 midterms have opened up the possibility for increased Latino representation in the US House of Representatives. But, the past has shown that Latino candidates aren't always selected for, or win elections in, majority Latino districts and that Latinos and non-Latinos who are elected don't always represent the views of their constituents. In new research, Angela X. Ocampo finds that political networks have a large influence on whether a Latino or non-Latino gets onto the ballot as a candidate. These networks are also often able to push candidates forward based on their legislative priorities, which may or may not align with the preferences of their constituents
basic similarity: 0.527161883329931
basic summary: This article is based on the paper The Wielding Influence of Political Networks: Representation in Majority- Latino Districts in Political Research Quarterly (PRQ). Lastly, the evidence showed that lack of coordination and fragmentation among existent political networks paved the way for the emergence of non-Latino candidates in majority-Latino districts. Political networks were also critical in narrowing down candidate fields when announced Latino and non-Latino candidates might weaken the chances of one another. The dataset included vote turns, candidate and district demographics and financial contributions made by the candidates themselves, individuals, parties and groups.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.4798051111031648
sim_matrix summary: Political networks were also critical in narrowing down candidate fields when announced Latino and non-Latino candidates might weaken the chances of one another. I investigated the activities of political networks in majority-Latino districts to understand why some districts are able to elect Latino representatives and some are not. I also compiled a dataset of the Latino and non-Latino candidates running in all open-seat congressional races from 2004 to 2014 that had a Latino population plurality. All of this suggests that political networks matter a great deal in shaping Latino descriptive and substantive representation.
text_rank similarity: 0.38292992910639856
text_rank summary: Political networks were also critical in narrowing down candidate fields when announced Latino and non-Latino candidates might weaken the chances of one another.For example, the evidence from Arizona’s 7th congressional district clearly showed that the candidates who were running in this district were supported by very different factions of the Democratic Party with distinct policy agendas.The dataset included vote turns, candidate and district demographics and financial contributions made by the candidates themselves, individuals, parties and groups.Obtained through a simulation from one of my models, Figure 1 below shows the predicted probability of a Latino candidate winning in a majority- Latino open-seat as a function of contributions from committees and parties, versus individual-level contributions, while holding all other candidate and district level variables constant.
tfidf similarity: 0.5602905813046116

sim_matrix summary: What is new – at least among white American students – is the wave of gun-control activism that has swept American schools, including Douglas itself.

Title: EU students at UK universities: patterns and trends
Word count: 624
Abstract: What Brexit will mean for UK universities varies from institution to institution. Much data on Brexit's impact focuses on sector-wide aggregates, the forest that hides the trees. The UK provides excellent teaching and research, as illustrated by the number of its universities ranked in the top 10, 50 or 100 in the world. Yet despite its world-class reputation, the UK's higher education sector is hierarchical, and various layers will be affected differently. Ludovic Highman (UCL) explores the sector’s diversity in this regard
basic similarity: 0.35516927936380516
basic summary: Currently they are treated as home students, but in all likelihood EU students enrolling in the UK after its withdrawal in March 2019 will be treated as overseas students. The diversity of the student fabric of UK universities, so crucial to the overall student experience, depends on a healthy number of non-UK based students interacting with domestic students. Scottish universities are attractive to non-UK EU students in absolute numbers, with Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen attracting more than Oxbridge and competing with the top London universities. EU students graduate from rigorous secondary school systems and their drive to study abroad, most often in a language that is not theirs, makes them attractive to UK universities. It is possible that higher concentrations of EU students will further relocate to Scotland, though this depends on the level of fees charged beyond 2020.

sim_matrix summary: Under the current tuition fee system, Scottish universities will remain attractive to prospective EU students, while many of their English counterparts (outside London and Oxbridge) that already have lower proportions of EU students will be less attractive if non-UK EU students lose their current status, comparatively-speaking. The tuition fee regime seems to have an impact on the choice of destination, as suggested by the high numbers and ratios of EU students in Scottish universities, while London as a global city attracts the most EU students. While the London Russell Group universities have the highest numbers of non-UK EU students (with UCL ahead, followed by King’s), and Oxbridge remains firmly cemented within the top 10, the data also demonstrate the attractiveness of Scottish universities, and the subsequent relative drop in the number of non-UK EU students in English universities that are not located in global cities such as Birmingham, London, or Manchester, or academic powerhouses such as Oxford and Cambridge. EU students tend to enrol in Russell Group universities. This is partly explained by the lack of tuition fees for non- UK EU students in Scotland.

Title: Book review: how to be a geek: essays on the culture of software by Matthew Fuller
Word count: 1358
Abstract: In How to be a Geek: Essays on the Culture of Software, Matthew Fuller explores the bits and bytes that have reshaped our world through a collection of essays that examines the figure of the geek and software cultures. While the lack of cohesive thread and use of terminology means this collection is best suited to scholars already familiar with the field rather than newcomers, the book contains some useful and astute insights, writes Wendy Liu
basic similarity: 0.3458043934321252
basic summary: Overall, How To Be a Geek is a useful addition to the field of software studies, geared primarily toward academics who are already enmeshed in the field. ‘Entities’, which contains three essays broadly touching on contemporary software culture, makes for smoother reading.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.4618761570962238
sim_matrix summary: Fuller himself is Professor of Cultural Studies at Goldsmiths University, and has published several other books on the subject of software studies, including Software Studies: A Lexicon (MIT Press, 2008) and Behind the Blip: Essays on the Culture of Software (Autonomedia, 2003). This is not a book for software developers looking for a critical perspective on software culture; How To Be a Geek is about the geek, not for the geek, and its goal is to shed some light on software culture for an academic audience, ideally one with some knowledge of social theorists like Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze.
text_rank similarity: 0.4556862473723378
text_rank summary: Those who are looking for a first-person account on the cultural aspects of software production should look elsewhere—Paul Graham’s Hackers & Painters or Ellen Ullman’s Close to the Machine come to mind—as Fuller’s approach is more about investigating the figure of the ‘geek’ through the lens of cultural studies, treating it as an intriguing specimen for academic analysis.There are some astute insights to be found as the book investigates software through the lens of cultural studies, though it will require some work on the part of the reader, as the prose blends terminology from both disciplines in a way that can be hard to follow.

Title: The more revisions a paper undergoes, the greater its subsequent recognition in terms of citations

Abstract: Is the peer review process simply a means by which errors are identified and corrected? Or is it a process in which a more constructive dialogue can take place and reviewers and editors may actively contribute to the text?

Title: It's not enough for research to be useful to policy actors, we must try to actually influence change
Word count: 1544
Abstract: There is no doubt that good communications and framing research and evidence for your audience is important to influencing policy and having research impact. But shouldn't we be aiming higher than producing and packaging research that simply meets the demands of policy actors? Surely what we actually want to do is influence change, not reinforce social and political norms? James Georgalakis argues that research and researchers need to challenge dominant paradigms and expose inconvenient truths. Relationships, networks, and bodies of knowledge play a far more significant role in change processes than short-term communications campaigns on specific research reports
basic similarity: 0.4660266580637651
basic summary: The first is the simple one favoured by research donors and think tanks that says that research, if packaged correctly, can directly “enlighten” policy actors. We try and overcome academics’ nervousness about policy engagement by demonstrating that research rigour and policy engagement can be mutually reinforcing. However, another model describes how by trying to shape research and evidence for policy we may actually allow politics to shape knowledge. Academics’ anxiety over engaging in policy, which can sometimes seem very inconvenient, centres less on the issue of measurement and more on the fundamental relationship between evidence and policy. The semi-professional disciplines of both policy influence and research impact always attract the communications crowd.

I am reminded of Andy Sumner’s work on the New Bottom Billion back in 2010 when IDS challenged the dominant view that development must be about tackling extreme poverty in the poorest countries.

Title: We need more carrots: give academic researchers the support and incentives to share data
Word count: 1120
Abstract: Making data available for other researchers to find, use, reuse, and reproduce is fundamental to open science, and ultimately makes research more efficient and effective. Yet despite funder policies that encourage and require data sharing, researchers in both the UK and the US report lower percentages of data sharing than the global average. In addition to progressive policies, Grace Baynes suggests researchers should be given incentives, expert support, training, and the infrastructure to make it seamless and easy to share data, and worth their while. Governments, funders, research institutions, libraries, and publishers all have a role to play to unlock the huge potential of research data

basic summary: Yet despite funder policies that encourage and require data sharing, researchers in both the UK and the US report lower percentages of data sharing than the global average. Our findings, Practical Challenges for Researchers in Data Sharing, are openly accessible in Figshare along with the survey data. While sharing data as supplementary information is better than not sharing data at all, it is a sub-optimal solution. Initiatives such as DataCite and the Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles help make research data more citable and discoverable.

frequency summary: Members of the newly formed UK Research and Innovation, an independent organisation that brings together the seven Research Councils, Innovate UK and Research England, the Wellcome Trust, and other UK funders have moved early to encourage and require data sharing. The issue for researchers may not be purely “lack of time” but “is it worth my time?” Published, citable datasets need to be viewed as research outputs on a par with a research article in terms of career advancement and assessment. For example, at Springer Nature we offer a free Research Data Support Helpdesk and recommended repositories list, as well as an optional Research Data Support service to help researchers and institutions deposit their data in repositories and make it easier to find and use. To achieve real “open science” we need to open up all areas of research, including research data.

Title: The neurotic academic: how anxiety fuels casualised academic work
Word count: 1380
Abstract: As higher education undergoes a process of marketisation in the UK and the activities of academic staff are increasingly measured and scrutinised, universities are suffused with anxiety. Coupled with pressures facing all staff, casualised academics face multiple forms of insecurity. While anxiety is often perceived as an individual problem for which employees are encouraged to take personal responsibility, Vik Loveday argues that anxiety amongst academic staff should be understood in two ways: as a symptom of casualised work in an increasingly competitive environment; and as a tactic of governance, ensuring compliance
basic similarity: 0.42852256777736447
basic summary: This blog post is based on the author’s article, “The neurotic academic: anxiety, casualisation, and governance in the neoliberalising university”, published in the Journal of Cultural Economy (DOI: 10.1080/17530350.2018.1426032). Anxiety, then, can be conceptualised as a kind of “tactic” of governance: fuelling hard work, a striving for so-called “excellence”, and the creation of obedient academic subjects. It will come as no surprise to those working in the UK’s higher education (HE) sector that universities are currently suffused with anxiety.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.4277521662824275
sim_matrix summary: Anxiety was one of the defining themes to emerge from the interviews, and – most obviously – the pervasiveness of anxiety appeared to be a kind of symptom of casualised employment within the increasingly competitive landscape of the neoliberalising sector. For those participants who had been working on multiple contracts for extended periods of time, fixed-term work had led to feelings of marginalisation and stress in the workplace and – in some serious cases – mental ill-health. In addition to pressures facing many staff in universities – such as time- management, meeting growing employer expectations, and the evaluation of performance – “casualised” contracts present particular challenges for those facing employment uncertainty: in a material sense, this can be a case of keeping up with regular payments for rent and bills, or providing for dependents; on a day-to-day basis, time is spent juggling existing contracts with job applications and interviews, whilst acknowledging that planning for the future often seems unthinkable – even farcical – in the face of the unknown.
text_rank similarity: 0.4231945097692811
text_rank summary: Far from providing convenient flexibility, the participants in my research felt as though they had very little control over their working lives apart from the possibility of “working on the self” – taking personal responsibility for productivity, success, and “excellence” through the pursuit of student satisfaction, publications, or external funding, which was often achieved through chronic over-work fuelled by anxiety, but with no financial security or guarantee of permanent work at the end of contracts.While anxiety is quite clearly an effect of the conditions under which it is produced, during the project I began to turn my attention to what anxiety itself might be achieving: in the first instance, anxiety can be seen as a symptom of precarious work, which affected the participants on an individual basis; yet their narratives also pointed to the more active role that anxiety played in the quest to find work and the forging of an “entrepreneurial academic self” appropriate to the demands of an increasingly competitive sector.The “privatisation of stress” involves a shift from examining the wider conditions under which we labour to a focus on the self, and the stressed-out figure of the casualised “neurotic academic” points not only to the personal but also the political costs of failing to resist processes that are detrimental to the health of staff and the wellbeing of the public university.

Title: PhD students supervised collectively rather than individually are quicker to complete their theses
Word count: 1366
Abstract: Given the choice, most PhD students would prefer to receive individual supervision rather than be supervised alongside their peers as part of a collective. This is understandable, given the undivided attention and precise, directly relevant advice one would receive. However, Hans Agné and Ulf Mörkenstam have compared the experiences of individually and collectively supervised students on the same doctoral programme and found that collective supervision, during the first year at least, is correlated with significantly shorter times to thesis completion compared to individual supervision
basic similarity: 0.4428941621617673
basic summary: Studied in this way, it appears that collective supervision of first-year doctoral students is correlated with significantly shorter times to thesis completion compared to individual supervision. Students who received collective supervision in the first year averaged 57 months in the programme, while students receiving individual supervision averaged 92 months. Multivariate statistical analyses of these observations support the conclusion that collective supervision in the first year does indeed reduce the time to completion of doctoral students.

sim_matrix summary: When it comes to assisting doctoral students to complete their theses on time or even as quickly as possible, this research has led us to believe that collective supervision in the first year of study significantly out-performs individual supervision. Studied in this way, it appears that collective supervision of first-year doctoral students is correlated with significantly shorter times to thesis completion compared to individual supervision. For example, it is well-known that time to doctoral completion depends on funding opportunities, the academic discipline, and the integration of doctoral students into ongoing research projects.

Title: Book review: deconstructing Dirty Dancing by Stephen Lee Naish
Word count: 1300
Abstract: In Deconstructing Dirty Dancing, Stephen Lee Naish unpacks the enduring popularity of the film Dirty Dancing, released to mixed reviews in 1987 before going on to become a global hit. Offering a comparative study of the film with David Lynch’s Blue Velvet before a scene-by-scene analysis and reflections on the film’s personal resonance for the author, the book is an idiosyncratic and accessible take on this cultural phenomenon, finds Penny Montague

Title: Svexit or Huxit? How another country could follow the UK out of the EU
Word count: 1656
Abstract: What are the chances of another country following the UK out of the EU? Eurosceptics in other states may be emboldened by the deal the UK manages to secure, especially if it includes access to the Single Market. Moves to further EU integration could have a similar effect. Simon Hix (LSE) and Nick Sitter (Central European University) look at the cases of Hungary and Sweden
basic similarity: 0.3837329547673884
basic summary: A scenario that would see Sweden as the next country to leave the EU would have to involve a substantial change in the cross-party political consensus on European integration. The most realistic basis for such a scenario would involve the emergence of a model of European integration that is more attractive for Sweden than full EU membership. Should Brexit lead to a new model that is more attractive than the EEA, the benefits of EU membership might seem less obvious. Second, a successful soft Brexit could conceivably provide an attractive alternative to full EU membership.

sim_matrix summary: If Hungary loses EU subsidies, the benefits of EU membership (to the government) would be dramatically reduced. Having said that, support for the EU is volatile in both countries, and how Brexit plays out and how the EU responds internally to Brexit will influence the direction of travel for the publics and political parties in these two countries. Second, a successful soft Brexit could conceivably provide an attractive alternative to full EU membership. The most realistic basis for such a scenario would involve the emergence of a model of European integration that is more attractive for Sweden than full EU membership.

text_rank summary: A scenario that would see Sweden as the next country to leave the EU would have to involve a substantial change in the cross-party political consensus on European integration.A key difference between Britain and the next member state to leave is that the next exit is more likely to result from cold calculation of the costs and benefits of EU membership rather than a miscalculation by a prime minister and a country’s political establishment.A soft Brexit that leaves the UK with substantial access to the Single European Market, but does not cross Theresa May’s red lines in terms of budget contributions, free movement and the reach of the EU judiciary, might be the Conservative party’s dream for Britain.In the midst of the rather shambolic Brexit process, and with the growing recognition of the potentially huge economic costs of leaving the EU single market and customs union, it might seem an inopportune time to ask who will be next to leave the EU.

frequency similarity: 0.5712680296045533
frequency summary: Even a “hard Brexit”, along the lines of a Canada-style free trade agreement with zero tariffs and zero quotas on goods, could provide a model for trade in goods that protect German carmakers’ presence in Hungary, and thus could allow Hungary to exit the EU without undue damage to one of its main expert industries. This “British model” may start to become attractive to some current member states, who may assume they could avoid some of the costs the UK has gone through in the Brexit process, and jump straight to the final settlement deal for the UK. However painful Brexit may seem for the UK in the short- or medium-term, once the relationship between the UK and EU has been partially settled (it will of course be an ongoing settlement), there will be a new “off the shelf” association for others to consider: a “British model”, in addition to the existing Norwegian, Swiss, Canadian, Turkish, Ukrainian, and so on. A soft Brexit that leaves the UK with substantial access to the Single European Market, but does not cross Theresa May’s red lines in terms of budget contributions, free movement and the reach of the EU judiciary, might be the Conservative party’s dream for Britain.

Title: Book review: fire and fury: inside the Trump White House by Michael Wolff
Word count: 1440
Abstract: With the overnight international bestseller Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, Michael Wolff utilises his ‘semipermanent seat’ on a West Wing sofa to offer an insider account of the Trump administration. While critical of Wolff’s writing style, methods and failure to separate clear falsehoods from certainties, Jonny Hall concedes that the book remains a gripping read that is at its most revealing when discussing the warring factions shaping Trump’s Presidency
basic similarity: 0.31272529503148705
basic summary: In sum, I would contend that this book is slightly more accurate than is generally being portrayed, but Wolff’s methods and writing style hardly aid his cause. This is one of the grievances of what Wolff or Trump might call the ‘mainstream media’: that Wolff’s book is simply ‘gossip’, and that ‘gossip isn’t journalism’.

text_rank similarity: 0.3796175181050702
text_rank summary: There is something to be said for Drew Margary’s view that Wolff’s book was only possible because of his different aims, but the willingness ‘to toss decorum aside and burn bridges’ hardly speaks to the critique of the author’s failure to offer any visible validity-based reflections.The note also includes the following: Many of the accounts of what has happened in the Trump White House are in conflict with one another; many, in Trumpian fashion, are baldly untrue.

tfidf summary: The book has become an international bestseller overnight, helped no doubt by the now-traditional Twitter explosion from President Donald Trump alongside the White House’s attempts to prevent the book’s publication – a la the Spycatcher affair in Britain in the 1980s. Where Wolff’s book is helpful sounds simplistic, but it is that it puts all of Trump’s blemishes in one place.

This is why the most important parts of this book aren’t the gossip-styled accusations regarding Trump which have excited great furore – that he would ideally be in bed with a cheeseburger by 6:30pm or that he called current White House Communications Director Hope Hicks a ‘piece of tail’ – but the information on White House infighting, which is essentially Bannon’s insight, and on how specific policies were formed.

Title: Metrics Mania: The Case Against Academia.edu
Word count: 1423
Abstract: Academia.edu has been called "Facebook for academics," and the analogy is fitting: Academia.edu mimics core social-media conventions, down to follower counts, curated profiles with pics, and a scrollable "News Feed" bulletin of followers’ uploads. But its reliance on user-facing metrics exceeds anything you’ll find on mainstream social media. It comes with a dedicated "Analytics" page resembling a gaming leaderboard or a corporation’s annual report. The charts and graphs encourage incessant monitoring, which dovetails with university policies that seek to measure quantifiable "impact." The result? Scholars are internalizing an analytics mind-set
basic similarity: 0.3342331147325014
basic summary: Scholars upload their paywalled papers, which become Google-indexed PDFs; the company uses these to draw in new members; the audience increases, prompting more scholars to upload their work. t most universities, annual evaluations and tenure decisions hinge on numbers: article counts, journal impact factors, h-index scores, and, perhaps, standardized teaching evaluations. This essay is based on an article, written with Brooke Erin Duffy, an assistant professor of communication at Cornell University, that recently appeared in Social Media + Society. With the audit culture lodged inside us, we don’t even need a warped incentive structure to overproduce papers and game the numbers. But now Academia.edu invites us to measure ourselves — to incorporate page views and download counts into our intellectual identities. "Academia is the easiest way to share papers with millions of people across the world for free," proclaims the site.

Academia.edu generates a data double for every scholar and then asks us to identify with it. Academia.edu aims to quantify that gauziest of academic qualities: inﬂuence. Scholars are caught in a "metric tide" imposed from above, and Academia.edu and ResearchGate, its rival, make administrators’ desires to quantify research seem achievable.

Who would turn down a 69-percent increase in citations, especially in competitive disciplines where citation ranking comes with material beneﬁts? "Academia is the easiest way to share papers with millions of people across the world for free," proclaims the site. While this has largely played out on a campus-by-campus basis, Academia.edu brings metrical tracking into a resolutely public arena.

Title: Effects of the concentration of solids on the phenomenon of super-elevation in artificial curved open channels
Word count: 1594
Abstract: This present study analyses the effects of the concentration of solids in the over-elevation phenomenon in a canalwith a 180° curvature and a constant trapezoidal transversal section, with a firm bed, the fluid has a non-colloidal,mono-disperse distribution of relatively spherical particles of 1mm in size, thus making the rheology of the flow de-scribable by the Einstein-Roscoe equation (1). Two stages are proposed for the development of the research; the firstcorresponds to physical experimentation, achieved using an artificial canal, in which 420 tests were carried out usingdifferent concentration of solids and two slopes, in order to determine the behaviour of the bi-phased flow. All of thisis carried out by using experimental results and results obtained from numerical models. The data collected from theexperimental process is compared to the results obtained from the theoretical models that are reported in literature.An over-elevation equation was formulated from the analysis, which can be used for the bi-phased conditions de-scribed in this article. During the second phase, numerical modelling using the TITAN2F software was carried out,where laboratory conditions are replicated. Data found from numerical modelling is compared with experimentalresults, with the intention of validating the numerical model that TITAN2F uses. From what is mentioned above, itwas deduced that TITAN2F effectively reproduces the hydraulic phenomenon. However, it is also observed that theprogram has a low susceptibility to changes in the concentration of solids, due to the scale being use

Title: Extending Internet to Powerless Areas
Word count: 2820
Abstract: Literature ReviewThe lack of internet in undeveloped countries and other rural areas is detrimental to the development of the area. Access to internet can have many profound effects on developing countries such as creating economic opportunities for small and medium sized businesses (Meltzer) and improving education (Purdue). In many of these rural areas and developing countries, such as Africa, children do not have up to date education (The Economist), people struggle to find jobs (ACET), and the infrastructure is lacking (The World Bank). The lack of internet in areas that have been affected by natural disasters is also a large problem that our society faces. Areas where the cellular towers and power generators were knocked out would benefit greatly from connectivity because it would allow the affected community to communicate with outside help.  One example of when internet needed to be extended to an area affected by disaster is Puerto Rico after Hurricane Irma knocked out over 90% of their cell service (Fiegerman). Some companies have attempted to create solar powered wi-fi hotspots, but none of them are implemented in the way that we plan to solve the problem. No product exists that can provide internet without cellular coverage nor a power grid. However, there are a couple of products that are in our area of research. The company Soluxio has created a solar powered wi-fi extender/LTE wi-fi hotspot. This is primarily for creating outdoor wi-fi networks in places with an existing internet connection or for resorts and city parks in developed areas where LTE data is available (Soluxio). The company Moja has created a microserver that also connects to LTE data. This device has the option to be solar powered, but it also has the same limitation as the Soluxio device in that it relies on LTE data which does not cover a large portion of the globe (Moja). Thesis Statement Design a system/device that can provide internet to areas that do not have reliable power or cellular coverage

Housing Design 17 Solar Panel Mount Design The only components that will not be kept in the HDPE housing will be the solar panels and satellite dish. That is why we have taken on the task to design a system/device that can provide internet to areas that do not have reliable power or cellular coverage. There are many areas in the world that do not have or have very sparse internet connections; some areas may even lack reliable power. Thesis Statement Design a system/device that can provide internet to areas that do not have reliable power or cellular coverage. Solar Panel Roof Mount The roof mount design is less expensive than the pole mount design, however it can only be used in areas with the proper infrastructure. Since many use cases for our device involves disaster relief areas, the device also needs to be able to withstand very rough climates and weather conditions. Our system is capable of producing its own power and sustaining itself and even 14 some excess power to the client. Since most of the Puerto Ricans do not have power or lights still, it would be imperative to have some sort of power source functionality. Areas where the cellular towers and power generators were knocked out would benefit greatly from connectivity because it would allow the affected community to communicate with outside help. No product exists that can provide 2 internet without cellular coverage nor a power grid.

Title: Animal Languages in the Middle Ages: Representations of Interspecies Communication
Word count: 227
Abstract: The essays in this interdisciplinary volume explore language, broadly construed, as part of the continued interrogation of the boundaries of human and nonhuman animals in the Middle Ages. Uniting a diverse set of emerging and established scholars, Animal Languages questions the assumed medieval distinction between humans and other animals. The chapters point to the wealth of non-human communicative and discursive forms through which animals function both as vehicles for human meaning and as agents of their own, demonstrating the significance of human and non-human interaction in medieval texts, particularly for engaging with the Other. The book ultimately considers the ramifications of deconstructing the medieval anthropocentric view of language for the broader question of human singularity

Title: Assessment of expression of interferon γ (IFN-G) gene and its antisense (IFNG-AS1) in breast cancer
Word count: 3148
Abstract: Background  The role of long non-coding RNAs has been extensively appreciated in the contexts of cancer. Interferon γ-antisense RNA1 (IFNG-AS1) is an lncRNA located near to IFN-γ-encoding (IFNG) gene and regulates expression of IFNG in Th1 cells. Methods  In the present study, we evaluated expression of IFNG and IFNG-AS1 in 108 breast samples including tumoral tissues and their adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANCTs) using real-time PCR. IFNG-AS1 was significantly upregulated in tumoral tissues compared with ANCTs (expression ratio = 2.23, P = 0.03). Results  Although the expression of IFNG was higher in tumoral tissues compared with ANCTs (relative expression = 1.89), it did not reach the level of significance (P = 0.07). IFNG expression was significantly higher in HER2-negative tumoral tissues compared with HER2-positive ones (P = 0.01) and in grade 1 samples compared with grade 2 ones (P = 0.03). No other significant difference was found in expressions of genes between other groups. Conclusion Significant strong correlations were detected between expression of IFNG and IFNG-AS1 in both tumoral tissues and ANCTs. The present study provides evidences for participation of IFNG and IFNG-AS1 in the pathogenesis of breast cancer and warrants future studies to elaborate the underlying mechanism

basic summary: IFNG expression was significantly higher in HER2-negative tumoral tissues compared with HER2-positive ones (P = 0.01) and in grade 1 samples compared with grade 2 ones (P = 0.03). In spite of several efforts to evaluate the effi- ciency of IFN-γ treatment in breast cancer, data regarding expression of IFNG gene in breast cancer tissues is scarce. Methods: In the present study, we evaluated expression of IFNG and IFNG-AS1 in 108 breast samples including tumoral tissues and their adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANCTs) using real-time PCR. Results: Although the expression of IFNG was higher in tumoral tissues compared with ANCTs (relative expression = 1.89), it did not reach the level of significance (P = 0.07). Expression analysis Relative expressions of IFNG and IFNG-AS1 genes were assessed in tumoral tissues and paired ANCTs in the rotor gene 6000 Corbett Real-Time PCR System. Table 3 shows the results of association analysis between relative expressions of genes in tumoral tissues compared with ANCTs and patients’ clinicopath- ological data. Elevated expression of IFNG-AS1 lncRNA has been reported in Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT) patients in correlation with the proportion of circulating Th1 cells and IFNG gene expression . We compared expression level of IFNG and IFNG-AS1 in each tumoral tissue vs. its paired ANCT and classified patients based on these values to upregulation and downregulation groups. No significant associations were found between patients’ clinicopathological data and fold changes of ex- pression of these genes in tumoral tissues compared with ANCTs.

Word count: 3707
Abstract: Background and aims: The current paper aimed to collect and document the information about medicinal plants of Boyer Ahmad and Dena regions and their applications by indigenous inhabitants. Methods: The field surveys were carried out from March 2015 to September 2016 under supervision of local people. Collected plant specimens were identified to species level using Flora of Iran and Flora Iranica. Subsequently, information including scientific names, local names, parts used, method of preparation, medicinal effects, growth forms, and chorotypes for 71 species were recorded. Results: Medicinal plants belonged to 62 genera and 29 families. Apiaceae (14.08%) and Lamiaceae (14.08%) had the most number of species among other families. Based on Raunkier method, hemicryptophytes with 42.25% is the highest growth form and the most common chorotype was Irano-Turanian type (70.42%). The most used parts are aerial parts (40/85%),‎ and the most common mode of preparation was infusion (24%). The results of this study indicate that local people in Boyer Ahmad and Dena regions have used all collected plants for medicinal, food and sanitary purposes and their knowledge about identification of plants and their habitats, medicinal and edible properties is extensive. Conclusions: Native knowledge leads to obtaining valuable information including medicinal properties of plants, usable parts, time of growth, best time for harvesting and areas which have growing potential. Therefore, it is vital to investigate the native knowledge about medicinal plants in various regions of Iran

Title: Immunotherapy in Allergic Rhinitis: It's Effect on the Immune System and Clinical Symptoms
Word count: 2998
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis is one of the most common allergic diseases and characterised by sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion and nasopharyngeal itching. Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) for specific allergens is an effective treatment and induces the inhibitory effect of T regulatory lymphocytes and decreases clinical symptoms in allergic rhinitis. AIM: In this study effect of subcutaneous immunotherapy with specific allergens on clinical symptoms and T regulatory and T Helper cells cytokines, in patients with allergic rhinitis are evaluated. METHODS: In this study, 30 patients with moderate to severe allergic rhinitis according to clinical criteria and positive skin prick test for aeroallergens were selected and treated by SCIT. Clinical symptoms and T cells cytokines IL4, IL17, IFN gamma, TGF beta, GITR, FOXP3 and IL-10 (by RT-PCR) were evaluated before and one year after initiation of treatment. RESULTS: Thirty (30) patients with allergic rhinitis at age range 15-45 years old were treated by SCIT, and 23 (14 female, 9 male) patients continued the study, and 7 patients did not continue treatment. After immunotherapy, clinical symptoms decreased significantly. The specific cytokines TGF beta and IL10 levels increased and changes were statistically significant. (Respectively P = 0.013 and P = 0.05) The IL17 level was also increased, but not statistically significant. (P = 0.8) IFN gamma, IL4, GITR, FOXP3, all decreased, but the changes were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Subcutaneous Immunotherapy for specific allergens decreases clinical symptoms in patients with allergic rhinitis and induces tolerance in T lymphocytes, especially by increasing T regulatory cells cytokines, TGF beta and IL10

It seems that immunotherapy has a major role in the induction of specific Treg cells and that the induction of tolerance in T lymphocytes is the base of immunotherapy. In our study, a significant decrease was observed in the clinical symptoms of allergic rhinitis patients after immunotherapy. Natural Treg cells react to autoantibodies which are expressed in the thymus whereas Inducable Treg cells react towards peripheral antigens which are expressed by dendritic cells . In the mentioned study those Treg cells originating from the thymus were named as nT-reg cells, and those forming outside the thymus were called aT-reg (adaptive) cells . In a study by Jutel et al., in 2003 in Switzerland, the mechanism of immunotherapy was studied in HDM- sensitive patients after 70 days of immunotherapy. The present study aimed at evaluating the effect of immunotherapy on the clinical symptoms and cytokine changes related to T lymphocytes in moderate to severe AR patients. Each of these subsets has a specific marker and express their specific receptors which for nTreg cells include CCR4/GITR/CTLA4/CD62L and for iTreg cells include IL10/TGF-beta.

Twenty three (23) individuals, 9 males and 14 females, completed the study. After immunotherapy, clinical symptoms decreased significantly. Moreover, IL15 which is one of the main factors in the survival and growth of T-cells is inhibited by IL10 and TGF-β [7]. One of the main characteristics of Treg cells is the expression of FOXP3 in them. Clinical symptoms and T cells cytokines IL4, IL17, IFN gamma, TGF beta, GITR, FOXP3 and IL-10 (by RT-PCR) were evaluated before and one year after initiation of treatment. Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Also, the inhibitory effects of IL10 on T-lymphocytes were due to changes in the CD28 mediated signalling pathway while the inhibitory effects of TGF-β were due to its inhibitory effect on TCR/CD3 and the inhibition of the CD28 pathway. It has been proved that following immunotherapy, the presence of FOXP3+ cells is increased in the nasal mucosa and this increase is consistent with the improvement of allergic rhinitis [4] [12].

AIM: In this study effect of subcutaneous immunotherapy with specific allergens on clinical symptoms and T  regulatory and T Helper cells cytokines, in patients with allergic rhinitis are evaluated. In a study by L.  Cosmi et al., on the effects of SLIT in allergic rhinitis  patients and mite-sensitive asthma, immunologic  changes included reduced allergen-specific IgE and  increased TGF-β, IL10 and IFN-γ levels [20]. Natural Treg  cells react to autoantibodies which are expressed in  the thymus whereas Inducable Treg cells react  towards peripheral antigens which are expressed by  dendritic cells [1] [11] [12]. Regarding the obtained results from this  study, it seems that the immunologic mechanism  leading to the alleviation and improvement of  symptoms in AR patients mainly includes a rise in the  number of inducible Treg cells accompanied by  increased TGF-β and IL10 levels. Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) for specific  allergens is an effective treatment and induces the inhibitory effect of T regulatory lymphocytes and decreases  clinical symptoms in allergic rhinitis. They stated  that an increase in the number of Treg, CD25+ and  CD4+ cells in allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT)  has a significant role and that immunotherapy with the  grass group will result in increased IL10 and TGF-β  expression in T cells and the mucosa. In the  mentioned study those Treg cells originating from the  thymus were named as nT-reg cells, and those  forming outside the thymus were called aT-reg  (adaptive) cells [15] [17]. Although FOXP3 is expressed to a lesser  degree by T-effector cells, the amount is very small,  and it is expressed transiently; therefore FOXP3 is  considered as a specific marker for Treg cells only  [13] [15]. RESULTS: Thirty (30) patients with allergic rhinitis at age range 15-45 years old were treated by SCIT, and 23 (14  female, 9 male) patients continued the study, and 7 patients did not continue treatment.

Title: Effects of Zingiber officinale hydro-alcoholic extract on\udHMG-COA reductase level in the testis of streptozotocininduced diabetic rats
Word count: 3553
Abstract: Introduction: Zingiber officinale Roscoe, commonly known as ginger, is used as a cooking spice and therapeutically for its antioxidant and androgenic activities. We investigated the effects of Z. officinale hydro-alcoholic extract on HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase level in the testis of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Methods: The current experimental study was performed on four groups of male Wistar rats one of them was kept as a healthy control, while the others were rendered diabetic via a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (60 mg kg-1). One group was considered as diabetic control; while the others were given orally hydro-alcoholic extract (200 and 400 mg kg-1) for 56 consecutive days. Body weight, blood glucose and insulin concentrations were evaluated using standard methods. The HMG-COA reductase level was determined by western blot analysis. Results: Treatment with the extract resulted in a significant reduction of serum glucose concentration and HMG-COA reductase level in the rat’s testis compared to diabetic controls (P<0.01). A significant increase in body weight was observed in treated diabetic rats. Also, serum insulin was significantly increased in diabetic rats treated with 400 mg/kg of the extract compared to diabetic controls (P<0.05). Conclusion: Ginger has a potential influence on the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis by modulating of HMG-COA reductase level. The results provide scientific evidence to confirm the traditional use of Z. officinale in the treatment of diabetes mellitus

basic summary: On the other hand, serum insulin level was significantly higher in diabetic rats treated with 400 mg/kg of Z. officinale extract than diabetic controls (29,30). Conclusion The oral administration of Z. officinale hydro-alcoholic extract has been shown to increases body weight, reduce blood glucose concentration and improve serum insulin levels in STZ-induced diabetic rats. Raw ginger extract can decrease serum cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels in diabetic rats and it has the great effect for controlling of diabetic complications (32). We investigated the effects of Z. officinale hydro-alcoholic extract on HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase level in the testis of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. According to the present study, Z. officinale extract can prevent weight loss in rats with STZ-induced diabetic and this effect may be related to its hypoglycemic properties. Some studies have shown that the ethanol extract of Z. officinale alleviates plasma lipids in cholesterol fed hyperlipidemia rabbits (12,13) and in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats (14). Also, serum insulin was significantly increased in diabetic rats treated with 400 mg/kg of the extract compared to diabetic controls (P < 0.05). Results: Treatment with the extract resulted in a significant reduction of serum glucose concentration and HMG-COA reductase level in the rat’s testis compared to diabetic controls (P < 0.01). Anti- diabetic and anti-oxidant effects of Zingiber officinale on alloxan-induced and insulin-resistant diabetic male rats. The effect of Z. officinale extract on the body weight, insulin level, and fasting blood glucose concentrations were assessed and the results are presented elsewhere (19).

Word count: 816
Abstract: Saat ini ketergantungan kita terhadap teknologi informasi telah meningkatkan kekhawatiran internasional akan keamanan informasi dan cyber dalam menghadapi serangan cyber yang bermotif politik, sosial dan agama. Panama Papers merupakan salah satu bentuk ancaman nyata dari serangan cyber. Karena serangan cyber dan kemampuan pertahanan terus berkembang dengan cepat, berbagai masalah yang terkait dengan kebijakan dan praktik dunia maya akan semakin meningkat dan akan memerlukan strategi keamanan nasional dan hubungan internasional yang komprehensif, salah satunya adalah negara Islandia. Setelah kebocoran Panama Papers, di negara tersebut terjadi protes baik dari lawan politik maupun dari masyarakat Islandia yang menuntut pengunduran Perdana Menteri negara tersebut. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk memberikan jawaban akan masalah yang diteliti yaitu untuk mengetahui dan menganalisa ancaman yang ditimbulkan oleh serangan cyber dari segi politik, keamanan, dan ekonomi dalam kasus Panama Papers. dalam penelitian ini yaitu stabilitas politik negara Islandia. Metode penelitian yang digunakan adalah jenis metode kualitatif yaitu penelitian tentang riset yang bersifat deskriptif dan cenderung menggunakan analisis. Selain itu penulis menggunakan metode historis analisis untuk menggambarkan peristiwa masa lampau agar dapat memahami peristiwa masa saat ini dan kemungkinan perkembangannya di masa mendatang. Panama Papers adalah kebocoran dari basis data firma hukum lepas pantai, Mossack Fonseca. Tax Havens memudahkan orang untuk menghindar dari membayar pajak kepada pemerintah mereka. Di antara para pemimpin nasional dengan kekayaan lepas pantai, salah satunya adalah perdana menteri Islandia, Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson. Setelah adanya Panama Papers, sejumlah anggota parlemen Islandia mengkritik peraturan yang ditetapkan oleh Perdana Menteri, dan masyarakat melakukan protes massa dengan menyerukan pemerintah untuk mengundurkan diri serta melakukan pemilihan baru. Kata Kunci: Serangan Cyber, Panama Papers, Stabilitas Politik Islandi

Title: Digital work design : the interplay of human and computer in future work practices as an interdisciplinary (grand) challenge
Word count: 3541
Abstract: Erworben im Rahmen der Schweizer Nationallizenzen (http://www.nationallizenzen.ch)More and more academic studies and practitioner reports claim that human work is increasingly disrupted or even determined by information and communication technology (ICT) (Cascio and Montealegre 2016). This will make a considerable share of jobs currently performed by humans susceptible to automation (e.g., Frey and Osborne 2017; Manyika et al. 2017). These reports often sketch a picture of ‘machines taking over’ traditional domains like manufacturing, while ICT advances and capabilities seem to decide companies’ fate. Consequently, ICT is often put at the core of innovative efforts. While this applies to nearly all areas of workplace design, a recent popular example of increasing technology centricity is ‘Industry 4.0’, which is often delineated as ‘machines talking to computers’
basic similarity: 0.2493970764501908
basic summary: Digital work designers must understand how and why things work before they can provide a digital solution to support work practices. 1 shows, traditional work design touches on motivational (e.g., autonomy and task variety), social (e.g., interdependence), and contextual (e.g., ergonomics) work design characteristics. 2 The Roots and Key Characteristics of Digital Work Design Workplace design has a long-standing tradition in ergo- nomics (Luczak 2013) and human-oriented computer sci- ence (Floyd et al. Organ Sci 11(4):404–428 Parker SK, Wall TD, Cordery JL (2001) Future work design research and practice: towards an elaborated model of work design. 1 Work design characteristics and work outcomes (based on Humphrey et al. If one accepts this change in the nature of work, researchers and practitioners need new approaches to analyze and (re)design work practices.

These design activities do not solely focus on technical artifacts. Boundary objects are often used to facilitate communication with stakeholders, coming from various disciplines (Bergman et al. Applying this holistic approach helps to identify requirements for the development of new adaptive human-centered automation approaches and prepares their implementation in organizations in terms of cultural change. Solution design and implementation have to be highly iterative and supported by a number of prototypical implementations with a rising degree of maturity.

Title: On the Obsolescence of Bourgeois Theory in the Anthropocene
Word count: 2421
Abstract: ‘On the Obsolescence of Bourgeois Theory in the Anthropocene’ is an attempt to think theory beyond the stereotypes of what it is considered to be. This includes preconceived notions of what it is to be a  theorist, and to create, publish and disseminate critical theory.Many thinkers, for example, are currently attempting to replace the tyranny of the human with an emphasis on the nonhuman, the posthuman and the Anthropocene. Yet such ‘post-theory’ theorists continue to remain bound up with the human in the very performance of their attempts to think through and beyond it. Regardless of the anti-humanist philosophies they profess — be they inspired by Deleuze, Kittler or Latour  — in their practices, in the forms their work takes, in the ways they create, publish and disseminate it, in their associated upholding of notions of individual human rights, freedom, property and so on, they continue to operate in terms of a liberal, humanist model of what it is to be and do as a theorist. ‘On the Obsolescence of Bourgeois Theory in the Anthropocene’ thus asks, what forms is critical theory to take if, in its performance, it is not to be simply liberal and humanist — nor indeed human — but something else besides? In this way it endeavours to anticipate a future where new roles and conditions for theory materialize that has never previously been imagined
basic similarity: 0.5759620106791554
basic summary: The nonhuman may be what a lot of contemporary theory studies and writes about, then, but it cannot take seriously the implications of the nonhuman for theory. Like the bourgeois novel, such theory — with rare exceptions — ‘draws a sharp distinction between the human and the nonhuman’, not to mention the ‘collective and collaborative’. Certainly, from the point of view of bourgeois theory, that which is outside its inherited liberal humanist frame in this respect can only appear as ‘strange’, ‘weird’, ‘freaky’. Just as ‘serious fiction, like bourgeois culture, now seems rather unserious, indeed frivolous’, so too does serious theory. For if the inhuman equals the human intertwined with the nonhuman, then a humanities with this intra-active inhuman figure at their heart must become the inhumanities. For ours is a time when theory too can be said to obscure rather than express the changing nature of the times and the time of nature.

Title: Improving Transformational Teaching and Learning by Advancing Higher Education Feedback-Based Dialogues at Texas A&M University
Word count: 3244
Abstract: Feedback mechanisms are critical to iteratively improving most societal systems, and yet there is minimal documentation on the best practices of leveraging feedback to improve teaching and learning in higher education. We attest that facilitated dialogues have the potential to start conversations relevant to improving policy that otherwise would not transpire. In higher education, facilitated dialogues between students, faculty, staff, and administration provide a unique face-to-face opportunity for all participants to provide feedback to one another on real-time institutional strengths and weaknesses. More specifically, facilitated dialogues have the potential to start a conversation on improving the learning in higher education. This work notes the theory facilitated dialogues and offers discussion on the long-term potential for such conversations to serve as a medium for iterative feedback in larger societal systems. Further, this thesis documents our development of a facilitated dialogue, The Student-Faculty Dialogue, which will act as a plenary event at Texas A&M?s inaugural Transformational Teaching and Learning Conference on April 17, 2018

Title: Identification and Characterization of a Mutated Gene Affecting NPC assembly
Word count: 3481
Abstract: The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a gateway that controls what is exchanged across the nuclear envelope. Therefore, when something affects its assembly, the cell will die. The laboratory has a collection of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant strains with NPC assembly defects, but where these defects are located and how they are related to NPC assembly remains unknown. The goal of this project is to identify the mutated gene that is causing assembly defects within one of the strains. Fluorescent microscopy was used to confirm the presence of a NPC assembly defect, and the growth rate of the mutant strain was measured at the permissive and nonpermissive temperature. Additionally, a genomic library was used to compliment the temperature sensitive defect as well as NPC assembly defect. Fluorescent microscopy confirmed the presence of an assembly defect. It was additionally found that the growth rate of the mutant was significantly slower at the nonpermissive temperature. Upon completing all transformations, none of the plasmids in the genomic library rescued the mutant. With information still missing by the mechanism of which NPC?s are formed, identifying and characterizing genes that affect NPC assembly can lead to more information about it
basic similarity: 0.7520913774905431
basic summary: Fluorescent microscopy was used to confirm the presence of a NPC assembly defect, and the growth rate of the mutant strain was measured at the permissive and nonpermissive temperature. Indeed, the wild-type cells shows a bright and continuous GFP pattern around the nucleus, indicating normal assembly and functioning nuclear pore assembly (npa) genes. Identifying genes that affect nuclear pore complex assembly, or the nuclear pore complex itself, provide more information about this vital process in every eukaryotic organism. This difference in growth rate signifies that the npa mutant of KRY141 is temperature sensitive and will fail to adequately grow when shifted to the nonpermissive temperature. A yeast genomic library (collection of genomic DNA from yeast) was used to rescue the mutation in order to learn more about what genes affect assembly. Additionally, a tiled genomic library was used to compliment the temperature sensitive defect as well as NPC assembly defect. The growth rates at room temperature were later used in comparison with the growth rates at the nonpermissive temperature. Genomic Complementation As seen from Table 2, none of the plasmids in the Prelich library were able to successfully rescue the temperature sensitive mutant phenotype (Jones, Prelich et. Doubling times of the wild-type and mutant strains were found at room temperature in order to establish their normal growth rate. As seen in Table 1, the slower doubling time between KRY141 and YGS53 at the nonpermissive temperature supports the fact that the npa defect is temperature sensitive.

text_rank summary: Indeed,  the wild-type cells shows a bright and continuous GFP pattern around the nucleus, indicating  normal assembly and functioning nuclear pore assembly (npa) genes.Genomic Complementation  As seen from Table 2, none of the plasmids in the Prelich library were able to  successfully rescue the temperature sensitive mutant phenotype (Jones, Prelich et.Given that there is still missing information about the assembly  process, there are several possibilities that this gene could encode for.My project is different because it will address a different  gene, but I will use similar materials and methods to achieve an answer to the research question.Doubling times of the wild-type and mutant strains were found at room temperature in order to  establish their normal growth rate.The slower doubling time could result from the  fact that important proteins, mRNA, and other essential cell components are impeded when  crossing the nuclear membrane if the NPCs are not assembled correctly.While the  possibility exists that the gene is contained in the Prelich library, Table 2 shows that the  probability that this plasmid is present in the library is incredibly low.One of the plates  of transformed cells was kept at room temperature to grow to assess how many should have been  seen at 34°C.Given that there are still several unknown steps in the process of NPC assembly,  identification of this gene should give the scientific community more insight.Using a mutant from the bank mentioned earlier, my project will focus on the  identification of the gene causing a mutated phenotype in the NPC.

tfidf summary: Genomic Complementation to Identify the Mutant Gene In an attempt to identify the gene affecting NPC assembly, complementation of the temperature sensitive mutant phenotype was done through a series of transformations using pools from the Prelich library (Jones, Prelich et. The NPC is also thought to play a role in cell division, including chromatin silencing. This number was then divided by 96, the number of plasmids in each pool. Figure 1. al 2008). The data was graphed using Excel in order to find an equation for the best fit line and the standard deviation. Upon completing all transformations, none of the plasmids in the genomic library rescued the mutant. Peering through the Pore: Nuclear Pore Complex Structure, Assembly, and Function. Meanwhile the mutant strain is characterized by mislocalization and discontinuous GFP patterns about the nucleus. To determine P(0), first, the number of colonies were counted at room temperature then multiplied by two in order to account for the fact that two plates were shifted to the nonpermissive temperature per transformation.

GFP-Nup Patterns  Since NPC assembly is essential for the NPC’s characteristic bidirectional transport, a  bank of yeast with temperature sensitive defects was generated and screened for mutations (Ryan  and Wente, 2002). Identifying genes that affect nuclear pore complex assembly, or the  nuclear pore complex itself, provide more information about this vital process in every  eukaryotic organism.

Title: APLIKASI THERMO-ELECTRIC GENERATOR PADA SISTEM\udPEMANEN PANAS BUANG PADA KOMPOR GAS SATU TUNGKU
Word count: 2049
Abstract: Pada saat memasak tidak semua panas diserap oleh panci atau pun masakan, tetapi ada panas yang terbuang di sekitar panci. Panas yang terbuang itulah yang akan dipergunakan sebagai energi alternatif. Alat yang mampu mengubah energi panas menjadi energi listrik adalah Thermo-Electric Generator (TEG). TEG adalah alat yang menggunakan prinsip kerja dari efek Seebeck. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah memanen panas buang dari gas buang samping panci yang sedang digunakan untuk memasak menjadi energi listrik serta membuat desain selimut TEG yang fleksibel, dalam artian mampu digunakan untuk dimensi kompor apapun dalam rumah tangga. Listrik yang dihasilkan dapat digunakan untuk proses kebutuhan listrik rumah tangga lainnya. Setelah dilakukannya pengujian diketahui bahwa terdapat beda temperatur (∆T) yang dihasilkan sehingga terdapat arus dan tegangan yang cukup dan bisa disambungkan dengan voltage regulator usb agar dapat digunakan untuk mengisi daya handphone dan semacamnya. Dapat disimpulkan panci yang berdiameter 140 mm dengan tinggi 110 mm memiliki ∆T yang konstan pada saat Api Kecil baris Bawah yaitu sisi Kiri = 8,7 °C; sisi tengah = 10,23 °C; dan sisi Kanan = 12,37 °C.

I.3 Tujuan dan Manfaat Penelitian Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah memanen panas buang kompor gas satu tungku yang sedang digunakan untuk memasak menjadi energi listrik. Panas yang terbuang itulah yang akan dipergunakan kembali sebagai energi alternatif yang bisa berguna untuk keperluan lainnya. Pada daerah sekitar panci terdapat panas yang terbuang atau yang tidak digunakan untuk proses memasak. TEG adalah alat yang menggunakan prinsip kerja dari efek Seebeck yang mampu mengubah energi thermal menjadi listrik. Pembangkit-pembangkit tersebut menghasilkan panas yang terbuang atau tidak digunakan yang dihasilkan bisa dari cerobong hingga generator. Panas yang terbuang tersebut bisa digunakan kembali menjadi energi alternatif lain yang berguna. Dikarenakan TEG memiliki ukuran yang cukup kecil sehingga mudah untuk diaplikasi kan pada lingkup rumah tangga dan aman digunakan disekitar manusia.

Title: Evaluation on the Effectiveness and Usability of the Developed  Collaborative Interaction Management System
Word count: 3673
Abstract: A Collaborative Interaction Management System (CIMS) is a system that potentially provide some assistance to the teachers in managing the studentâ€™s collaborative interaction in forum discussions. The projected main function of the CIMS is to provide tools that automatically gauge the quality of interaction as reflected in studentâ€™s individual contributions so as to make it easier for the instructor to make judgments on the effectiveness of the collaborative process. This study aims to assess&nbsp;&nbsp; how effective and usable is the developed CIMS based on the evaluation of faculty and students. The descriptive research design is utilized in this study. The five-point Likert scale is used and the gathered data are statistically interpreted through the utilisation of a weighted mean. The sample population of this study is the one hundred twenty participants coming from the different universities in the area where the survey was conducted. The researcher adopted a survey instrument made by some software specialists. The bases of the instrument are some of the characteristics listed on the software quality model of ISO 9126. These are the functionality, usability and the reliability. Each of these software characteristics is described by some indicators to obtain the responses of the participants. The overall evaluation of the participants displayed the weighted mean of 4.0, thus it can be concluded that the functionality, usability and reliability of the software is very good

Title: Artificial intelligence in cardiology : applications, benefits and challenges
Word count: 2063
Abstract: Evidently, the potential benefits of AI in cardiology are enormous.  However, such benefits are not without challenges.  First, there are clear benefits for improving work productivity. There are currently fewer physicians to care for an ever - increasing aging population (WHO 2016). AI can support, rather than replace physicians, generating time - and cost - saving benefits for them and their patients and enabling more compassionate and thorough interactions. However, as more tasks become automated, there are possibilities that fewer physicians will be required to work or that fewer will do so on a full - time basis, since many tasks could be delivered through platforms by part-time, freelancer physicians. This may impact the relationship between patients, physicians and administrative staff in healthcare systems
basic similarity: 0.25380433780219774
basic summary: Machine learning can positively impact cardiovascular disease prediction and diagnosis by developing algorithms that can model representations of data, much faster and more efficiently than physicians can. Thus, results from unsupervised learning algorithms can feed into supervised learning algorithms for predictive modelling. To develop such intelligent systems machine learning algorithms are required to enable dynamic learning capabilities in relation to changing conditions. Such predictive models can be produced with “supervised learning” algorithms that require a dataset with predictor variables and labeled outcomes (Johnson et al 2018). 3 Increased data storage, high computing power and exponential learning capabilities together enable computers to learn much faster than humans and address the challenge of limitless choice. This may impact the relationship between patients, physicians and administrative staff in healthcare systems (see Taylor et al 2016). What matters the most is the clinical efficacy of algorithms and their use of data (Future Advocacy 2018).

Title: The effect of informal Central Bank communication : machine learning approach
Word count: 803
Abstract: The management of agents’ expectations is a key feature of monetary policy because the central bank only has direct control over very short-term interest rates. The main tool to influence people’s expectations is communication. A number of both qualitative formal (e.g. statements and minutes) and informal (speeches) channels as well as quantitative channels, such as economic projections, are currently used by policymakers. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the effects of central bank communication can contribute to effective monetary policy. For instance, it may help the European Central Bank to phase out the quantitative easing without causing severe instability. It is important to emphasise that this research is not about explicit forward guidance but instead focuses on the overall positive or negative sentiment (tone) about economic conditions in speeches. The paper investigates three hypotheses regarding the effect of positive or negative sentiment (tone) about economic conditions conveyed in Bank of England speeches on government bond yields in the United Kingdom: (H1) A positive sentiment (tone) about economic conditions conveyed in speeches should have a positive effect on bond yields. (H2) The impact of a speech should vary by the position of a speaker. Speeches by more senior people should have a larger effect. (H3) The stock of communication matters. If there was little communication prior to the speech, the impact of a speech should be larger
basic similarity: 0.6280797300963465
basic summary: Finally, the sentiment index is calculated by counting the number of positive and negative words in relevant parts of speeches. The estimates should be close to true values as there are not many factors that affect bond yields and are correlated with the sentiment index. A standard-deviation increase in the sentiment index leads to around a 1–1.7 basis point rise in the bond yields across the curve. Such use is not ideal as markets should react only to the surprise component of the sentiment (the difference between the absolute index and its expectations). The magnitude of the effect is similar to that for the surprise component of consumer price index (CPI) data releases. It would be interesting to estimate the effect for a longer horizon than one day to investigate whether the effect persists. statements and minutes) and informal (speeches) channels as well as quantitative channels, such as economic projections, are currently used by policymakers. Primary limitations of this research are related to measurement error in the sentiment index. In addition, an absolute index, which ignores market expectations, has been used due to the lack of data. if there was no communication in the week prior to the speech, the effect is two- to three- times larger. For example, ‘increasing risk’ and ‘increasing growth’ would both be classified as positive phrases even though the former is clearly negative. The methodology to estimate the sentiment index can be applied to other contexts.

sim_matrix summary: The paper investigates three hypotheses regarding the effect of positive or negative sentiment (tone) about economic conditions conveyed in Bank of England speeches on government bond yields in the United Kingdom: (H1) A positive sentiment (tone) about economic conditions conveyed in speeches should have a positive effect on bond yields. Finally, the sentiment index is calculated by counting the number of positive and negative words in relevant parts of speeches. After calculating the sentiment index, daily changes in the yields of two-, five- and ten-year government bonds are regressed on lagged values of the dependent variable, the sentiment index and control variables (monetary surprises and surprise components of macroeconomic data releases) in order to account for factors that can affect bond yields during the day. The methodology to estimate the sentiment index can be applied to other contexts. Such use is not ideal as markets should react only to the surprise component of the sentiment (the difference between the absolute index and its expectations). It is important to empha- sise that this research is not about explicit forward guidance but instead focuses on the overall positive or negative sentiment (tone) about economic conditions in speeches. If there was little communication prior to the speech, the impact of a speech should be larger. if there was no communication in the week prior to the speech, the effect is two- to three- times larger. Another interest- ing finding is that Deputy Governors and other Monetary Policy Committee members have little or no effect on bonds, indicating that markets only react to speeches from the most senior people. A standard-deviation increase in the sentiment index leads to around a 1–1.7 basis point rise in the bond yields across the curve. The estimates should be close to true values as there are not many factors that affect bond yields and are correlated with the sentiment index.

text_rank summary: For example, ‘increasing risk’ and ‘increasing growth’ would both be classified as positive phrases even though the former is clearly negative.The results are largely in line with Ehrmann and Fratzscher (Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 2007), who manually code all speeches as positive, negative or neutral.If markets need more time to absorb new information, the long-run implications may be different.After calculating the sentiment index, daily changes in the yields of two-, five- and ten-year government bonds are regressed on lagged values of the dependent variable, the sentiment index and control variables (monetary surprises and surprise components of macroeconomic data releases) in order to account for factors that can affect bond yields during the day.E50 The management of agents’ expectations is a key feature of monetary policy because the central bank only has direct control over very short-term interest rates.In addition, an absolute index, which ignores market expectations, has been used due to the lack of data.The paper investigates three hypotheses regarding the effect of positive or negative sentiment (tone) about economic conditions conveyed in Bank of England speeches on government bond yields in the United Kingdom: (H1) A positive sentiment (tone) about economic conditions conveyed in speeches should have a positive effect on bond yields.It is important to empha- sise that this research is not about explicit forward guidance but instead focuses on the overall positive or negative sentiment (tone) about economic conditions in speeches.Finally, the sentiment index is calculated by counting the number of positive and negative words in relevant parts of speeches.Moreover, the same analysis could be repeated for more countries and types of communication.if there was no communication in the week prior to the speech, the effect is two- to three- times larger.The main tool to influence people’s expectations is communication.

Title: Editorial: Practitioner Research in Higher Education, 11 (1)
Word count: 1570
Abstract: This special issue of Practitioner Research in Higher Education focuses specifically on assessment and feedback. We know that assessment has a powerful influence on student engagement and learning, making it an important focus for enhancement activity. We also know, however, that assessment is a nuanced, complex and contested area of university practice, which makes it a notoriously challenging one to change. Heightened awareness of the centrality of assessment-related matters, a commitment to scholarly endeavour and the processes of conducting, sharing and debating diverse approaches and perspectives are all vital. The two research papers and nine evaluation studies of innovative practice in this issue provide insight into the ways that many academics are, in various ways, investigating and enhancing their practice in this important area

Title: Digital skills, confidence and motivation: technology supported authentic learning in journalism education
Word count: 1149
Abstract: This study explores the use of technology to incorporate authentic learning practices into the Review and Lifestyle Journalism module at Staffordshire University. The research takes a constructivist view, considering both tutor observation and student feedback to evaluate an experiential journalism project, StaffsLive Reviews, developed in the academic year 2016-17. Here authentic learning is defined as designing activities to provide meaningful, ‘real-life’ situations which are relevant from a student’s perspective, while providing protective scaffolding to support learning (Icuc and Marin 2014 and Stein 2004). This encapsulates a broader institutional focus on employability, by designing activities that closely match ‘real-world’ tasks of media professionals (Lombardi 2007)

James  Crabbe FRSA asks how far we have really moved since.In his influential book published in 1968  the British criminologist, Nigel Walker, set out what he believed should be the aims of a  penal system: to protect offenders and suspected offenders against unofficial retaliation; and  to reduce the frequency of the types of behaviour prohibited by criminal law. In seeking to  meet these aims, Walker adds that the penal system should seek to cause the minimum of  suffering (whether to offenders or to others) and be designed to ensure that it would not  increase the incidence of offences.

Title: Translating Gesture from Sculpture to Text
Word count: 3826
Abstract: This is a collaborative practice-based investigation which aims to outline some of the key lessons and implications from a number of the uses of gesture in the sculpture of Barbara Hepworth. This mini-research project consists of this formal academic paper and a selection of digital multimedia poetry which functions as a creative-critical intervention and a component part of this paper. The digital multimedia poetry was created in collaboration by the authors in response to Hepworth’s original sculpture at the Barbara Hepworth Museum (St Ives) and the Hepworth Wakefield (Yorkshire). The creative element of the investigation attempts to model Hepworth’s use of gesture and in doing so translate the function of gesture from its use in a visual arts practice to a multimedia textual practice. Building on a multi-disciplinary understanding of gesture and Hepworth’s own ideas about “gesture in landscape”, the project considers the gestures of the artist, gestures represented in the artwork, and gestures choreographed by the artwork (in the reader/audience/participant). The collaboration features new interactive works and is intended to function as a provocation raising questions about the interaction between tension and gesture in both sculptural and digital textual practices, rather than an authoritative, exhaustive or conclusive typology of the use of gesture in Hepworth’s corpus
basic similarity: 0.68636738431871
basic summary: Indeed the gesture of formation of an artwork creates a dynamic tension between the gesture of the artist and the virtual formation of that being represented. In those previously discussed works which enact gesture in landscape (drawing upon waves, natural rock forms, and sea caves) the repeated actions of nature are inscribed within the form. (Hepworth 5) 15A third use of gesture in Hepworth’s work is the gesture of invitation. It features eighteen digital poems created collaboratively which attempt to implement the three different uses of gesture in Hepworth’s work identified above. There is room for development in both the practice work and in sketching out a fuller typology of gesture as it functions in Hepworth’s work. Yet we have begun with an identification of gestures of tension, formation and invitation, and these functions have proved a useful starting point for new collaborative practice.

Hepworth  © Bowness    Figure 6: Barbara Heptworth, Pendour (1947). Hepworth  © Bowness   11When describing “gesture in landscape” in her autobiography, Hepworth nods to some of these forces in  her own work:  In all these shapes the translation of what one feels about man and nature much be conveyed by  the sculptor in terms of mass, inner tension and rhythm, scale in relation to our human size and  the quality of surface which speaks through our hands and eyes. Hepworth ©  Bowness   10Implosion too is an implied future action, another “about to happen” that can be read in some of  Hepworth’s pieces.

text_rank summary: Conclusion  22In the course of the research for this project, which saw us draw upon our existing personal relationships  with the relevant landscapes and each other’s practice (in addition to the usual book-based research and  museum visits), we have made inroads into both emergent digital poetry practice methods and our  understanding of the function of gesture in Hepworth’s sculpture.Interestingly the impact of translating this shaping function into  our practice, has led to a number of the virtual works taking on a distinctly sculptural quality.4  6The next portion of the paper outlines and defines three uses of gesture (as defined above) which we have  identified in Hepworth’s sculpture: gestures of tension, gestures of formation and gestures of invitation.This gesture towards past action is not unusual in  choreography and performing arts (consider for instance the clown drawing a tear on his face, expressing  that he has been made sad by the previous event), but it is especially pertinent to static art forms where  gesture is the gateway to the experience of formation.This specificity does not translate well to  all practices, notably in the use of gesture in music and the acoustic arts in which the shape that implies  action need not be tied to the human form.Hepworth © Bowness    16Hepworth herself invites the audience to be embraced by the pierced form:  The forms which have had special meaning to me since childhood have been the standing form  (which is the translation of my feeling towards the human being standing in landscape); the two  forms (which is the tender relationship of one living thing beside another); and the closed form,  such as the oval, spherical or pierced form (sometimes incorporating colour) which translates  for me the association and meaning of gesture in landscape; in the repose of say a mother and  child, or the feeling of the embrace of living things, either in nature or the human spirit.Figure 1: The researchers on St Mary’s, Isles of Scilly    Gesture  2This research project involves attempting to translate “gesture” as an art function across two very different  art practices, cultures and media-forms.

This project considers the gestures of the artist, gestures represented in the artwork, and gestures choreographed by the artwork (in the reader/audience/participant). Building on a multi-disciplinary understanding of gesture and Hepworth’s own ideas about “gesture in landscape”, the project considers the gestures of the artist, gestures represented in the artwork, and gestures choreographed by the artwork (in the reader/audience/participant). In physics, tension is a force and a type of potential energy stored within matter: here too a future action or movement is implied. 13Aside from the literal sculpting work and craftsmanship involved, some works imply alternative conceptual formations.

frequency summary: Gestures of Tension  7If gesture is a shape which implies action, gestures of tension are those shapes whose implied action takes  place in the future; gestures of tension suggest that something is “about to happen” and express imminence,  and this is analogous to the way the term “tension” is used in narrative studies (e.g. The first four poems are image-based and use projective  verse, open form and visual techniques to create gestural textual environments; this is particularly apparent  in the precarious forms in “Zennor Carn” and “Lanson” and the unstable three-line stanza in “Lankidden”. These poems attempt to bring together some of the ideas and functions  from the “Kinetic” and “Static” works, and most attempt to implement one or more of the gesture functions  identified in Hepworth’s work. Le texte est destiné  à provoquer, par l’emploi d’oeuvres interactives, la réflexion sur les liens entre tension et geste en sculpture et dans les  textes numériques, plutôt qu’à cataloguer les gestes chez Hepworth dans le but d’en faire une typologie exhaustive. This mini-research  project consists of this formal academic paper and a selection of digital multimedia poetry which functions  as a creative-critical intervention and a component part of this paper.1 The digital multimedia poetry was  created in collaboration by the authors in response to Hepworth’s original sculpture at the Barbara  Hepworth Museum (St Ives) and the Hepworth Wakefield (Yorkshire). Put simply digital poetry is poetic practice which necessarily  involves the use of computational devices or digital media, and it is a subset of electronic literature, which  refers to “works with important literary aspects that take advantage of the capabilities and contexts  provided by the stand-alone or networked computer” (ELO).5 This medium for poetry affords great  potential for creating virtual poetry environments which a reader can navigate and interact with and there  is a rich tradition of works which take advantage of that potential (consider for instance “Poemas no meio  do caminho” by Rui Torres).

Title: The impact of communities of practice on masters dissertations: a small scale case Study of MSc project management students
Word count: 3177
Abstract: Communities of Practice (CoPs) are known to increase knowledge sharing and personal development. In this pilot study in a UK higher education institution, we explored using CoPs with Postgraduate (Masters and PhD) students with a view to investigating the CoPs’ impact on the Masters students’ dissertation engagement and achievement.  We conducted action research, forming 4 CoPs, each including 1 PhD student and approximately 3 MSc students. We analysed the 11 MSc Project Management students’ engagement, results and feedback and the 4 Project Management PhD researchers’ feedback using mixed methods from questionnaires, feedback forums and quantitative analysis of dissertation results (marks). We found four categories of outcome: (i) MSc students’ mode of communication with their CoP; (ii) MSc students’ contribution to their CoP; (iii) benefits to MSc students; and (iv) impact on MSc dissertation results. Our outcomes show that the CoP had an impact on MSc student engagement and performance, and indicate CoPs as worthy of further investigation for enhancing students’ learning experience

basic summary: The Masters students were full‐time MSc Project Management students, 8 were international students and the remaining 3 were home students. The final dissertation marks indicated that five students achieved Distinction (>=70%) for their dissertation and all these students had High or Medium engagement with their CoP. 5.0 Conclusion A pilot study was used to investigate the impact of ‘Communities of Practice’ on MSc Project Management students’ engagement and achievement in their dissertation. This study aims to investigate the impact of the CoPs on MSc Project Management students’ dissertation experience by evaluating student engagement and results. The empirical setting for this study is the University of Bedfordshire MSc Project Management course, involving 11 Masters students, with 4 PhD research students, each supporting a CoP. This study used both secondary and primary data; The secondary data included existing literature and archival statistical records of previous students’ performance at the dissertation stage.

Title: Infrared spectroscopy of the merger candidate KIC 9832227
Word count: 2997
Abstract: Context. It has been predicted that the object KIC 9832227 – a contact binary star – will undergo a merger in 2022.2±0.7.We describe the near infrared spectrum of this object as an impetus to obtain pre-merger data. Aims. We aim to characterise (i) the nature of the individual components of the binary and (ii) the likely circumbinary environment, so that the merger – if and when it occurs – can be interpreted in an informed manner. Methods. We use infrared spectroscopy in the wavelength range 0.7 μm–2.5 μm, to which we fit model atmospheres to represent the individual stars. We use the binary ephemeris to determine the orbital phase at the time of observation. Results. We find that the infrared spectrum is best fitted by a single component having effective temperature 5 920 K, log [g] = 4.1 and solar metallicity, consistent with the fact that the system was observed at conjunction. Conclusions. The strength of the infrared H lines is consistent with a high value of log g, and the strength of the Ca ii triplet indicates the presence of a chromosphere, as might be expected from rapid stellar rotation. The He i absorption we observe likely arises in He excited by coronal activity in a circumstellar envelope, suggesting that the weakness of the Ca ii triplet is also likely chromospheric in origin

basic summary: V. Pavlenko et al. The UTC time of mid-observation of our spectrum (2457942.04199) was converted into the BJD(TDB) timescale using the IDL routines from Eastman et al. In the case of the Sun the line is also observed in absorp- tion; Avrett et al. Significant molec- ular features are not seen in the observed spectrum, therefore we accounted for only atomic lines from the VALD3 database (Ryabchikova et al., 2015). Middle panel: best the fit to the observed Ca ii triplet, with classical and “chromospheric” model atmo- spheres. Indeed, our fits of the theoretical spec- tra computed for log g = 4.19 and log g = 4.10 to the observed spectra are far superior. Left: dereddened IRTF spectrum of KIC 9832227, together with the fit with b = 1; the case b = 0 is also shown for comparison. Right: fit to the spectrum containing Si I lines, marked by vertical arrows; the He i line is also shown. However, we see that practically all notable lines in the near IR spectrum are well fitted with close-to-solar abundances; the likely errors do not exceed 0.3 dex. The discrepancies between computed and observed Ca ii lines strength may be explained by several factors, such as NLTE effects or a Ca deficit. 3 we show the hydrogen lines computed for the case of lower log g = 2.0. We draw particular attention to the modelling of the moder- ately strong hydrogen lines, to which our model provides a satis- factory fit.

We also note here an alternative interpretion: our classical model atmospheres were computed for Rosseland mean optical depth in the range τRoss = 10−5 – 100 but such models lead to Ca ii lines that are too strong. ⋆ E-mail:yp@mao.kiev.ua KIC 9832227 was identified by Molnar et al.

Title: MetQy – an R package to query metabolic functions of genes and genomes
Word count: 2469
Abstract: Summary: With the rapid accumulation of sequencing data from genomic and metagenomic studies, there is an acute need for better tools that facilitate their analyses against biological functions. To this end, we developed MetQy, an open–source R package designed for query–based analysis of functional units in [meta]genomes and/or sets of genes using the The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Furthermore, MetQy contains visualisation and analysis tools and facilitates KEGG’s flat file manipulation. Thus, MetQy enables better understanding of metabolic capabilities of known genomes or user–specified [meta]genomes by using the available information and can help guide studies in microbial ecology, metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.  Availability and Implementation: The MetQy R package is freely available and can be downloaded from our group’s website (http://osslab.lifesci.warwick.ac.uk) or GitHub (https://github.com/OSS-Lab/MetQy)

sim_matrix summary: This example demonstrates how MetQy can be used to retrieve KEGG genome data and how the metabolic functions of the extracted/matched organisms can be queried/identified in terms of KEGG modules. Users with a paid KEGG subscription can use MetQy parsing functions to update the data that the package uses. The MetQy parsing functions allow the production of the updated data, by formatting the relevant KEGG data files into R structures. They can also be used as stand–alone functions to introduce KEGG data into the R environment. Users without FTP access can analyse the KEGG genome, module and ortholog databases indirectly by using this family of functions on built–in formatted KEGG data which is not directly accessible by the user.

In addition, the function performs, for every factor group specified, the following analyses: 6) group the genomes according to that factor and create a heatmap of the mean mcf for each module across the genomes that make up each group, 7) carry out a PCA analysis on all the mcf data, showing the cumulative variance and generating a PC plot, 8) visualise the PC plot with an overlay of the factor grouping, and, finally, 9) measure the within-group (per factor) variance, using the mean Euclidean distance as a proxy for spread. While this example highlights how specific MetQy functions can be utilised on their own to develop a specific analysis pipeline, it is also possible to use MetQy functions to perform an automated analysis on a set of genomes grouped by genus (or another grouping factor provided by the user, e.g. Additionally, these functions feature optional arguments that allow users to provide up–to–date data (by using the parsing functions on KEGG FTP data) or their own data structures, such as custom–made KEGG–style modules. 2.3 Analysis and visualisation The analysis and visualisation family of functions are designed to facilitate the analysis primarily of the output of the query_genomes_to_modules function, which generates a matrix of mcf values for the genomes and modules analysed.

Title: Computer modelling of hafnium doping in lithium niobate
Word count: 2118
Abstract: Lithium niobate, LiNbO3, is an important technological material with good electro-optic, acousto-optic, elasto-optic, piezoelectric and nonlinear properties. Doping LiNbO3 with hafnium, Hf has been shown to improve the resistance of the material to optical damage. Computer modelling provides a useful means of determining the properties of doped and undoped LiNbO3, including its defect chemistry, and the effect of doping on the structure. In this paper, Hf doped LiNbO3 has been modelled, and the final defect configurations are found to be consistent with experimental results
basic similarity: 0.5955483002806872
basic summary: Interatomic Potentials In this paper use has been made of a previously derived potential for LiNbO3 , and a potential fitted to the structure of HfO2. Much useful information about lithium niobate and its defect properties can be obtained by computer modelling, based on the description of interactions between ions by effective potentials. Computer modelling provides a useful means of determining the properties of doped and undoped LiNbO3, including its defect chemistry, and the effect of doping on the structure. Future calculations will be carried out which will model the effect of Hf concentration on the preferred dopant sites, enabling comparison with these results to be made.

Title: Management services and supporting the board
Word count: 2583
Abstract: There are steps that directors and boards can take to ensure that those who support them are themselves supported and enabled to obtain access to the information and papers they need to fulfil their responsibilities, avoid conflicts of interest and provide independent and objective advice. This article considers factors that senior executives and audit, legal, governance, risk, compliance and other management services professionals should consider when making the transition on a whole or part-time basis from supporting management and improving performance to supporting the board and providing assurance. Published as: Coulson-Thomas, Colin (2018), Management Services and Supporting the Board, Management Services, Vol. 62 No. 3, Autumn, pp 22-2

basic summary: Ensuring Relevance Individual compliance, environmental, governance, finance, legal, risk, internal audit and other professionals with a corporate wide remit and assurance role will often focus upon particular areas. The heads of certain support functions should have a direct right of access to the independent or non-executive members of a committee or board without management colleagues being present. Escalation routes to a committee or board chairman may be required, as concerns could relate to top management or a chief executive officer. This could be achieved by mapping processes, identifying factors that either deliver or could frustrate the delivery of key board and corporate objectives, and ensuring they are covered. Those who are engaged in assurance activities on behalf of a board and advising and supporting it are often professionals with their own codes of practice and standards.

Title: Characterisation of the Clothespin relocation task as a functional assessment tool
Word count: 4056
Abstract: Method:	 The Clothespin Relocation Task has been adapted from an arm training tool to create an instrument to measure hand function.  It is based in the time to move three clothespins from a horizontal to a vertical bar, and back.    To be generally useful, the measures need to have their psychometric properties investigated.  This paper measures the characteristics of an able bodied population to gain an understanding of the underlying statistical properties of the test, in order that it can then be used to compare with different subject groups.  Fifty adults (29 males, 21 females, mean age 31) were tested with five runs of three clothespins  moved up and then down.  Ten subjects returned twice more to observe repeatability.    Results: There was a non-Gaussian range of times, from 2.5s to 7.37s.  Mean time for Up was 4.1s, and was 4.0s for Down, with a skew towards the faster times of 0.57 for Up and 0.97 for Down.  Over the three sessions there was a small (not significant) increase in speed 4.1+/-0.5s first run Down to 3.5 +/-0.4s for third.  Conclusion: These initial tests confirm that it has potential to be used as a measurement of the performance of arm movement

Clothespin Relocation Test The Clothespin Relocation Test (CRT) is an established tool for training upper limb dexterity. Similarly to the times to move the pins Up there is an upper limit for the times and longer distribution of the slower times. When a modified version of the CRT, (with a standardised pin order for motion analysis), was used with four prosthesis users the times were longer than the unaffected users.

Its distribution is non Gaussian with a skew towards the lower times for able bodied subject using their dominant hand. The results suggests that it can be used as a test, repeated over time to monitor changes in performance or for comparisons of prosthesis design including control strategies. Measurement is the time to move 3 red clothespins from 3 positions (top, middle, bottom) on the vertical bar to anywhere on the middle horizontal bar. Measurement is the time to move 3 red clothespins from 3 positions (left, middle, right) on the middle/medium horizontal bar to anywhere on the vertical bar.

Title: New development: 4P recommendations for implementing change, from research in hospitals
Word count: 3535
Abstract: How are hospital staff involved in process improvement initiatives such as Lean? What can we learn from Lean implementation experiences about the sustainability of such initiatives? The authors considered such questions in a study of workplace change in Australia and Canada. They found that Lean is more likely to be sustained when leaders adopted the 4P recommendations presented in this article
basic similarity: 0.2508744506855707
basic summary: All staff need to understand how Lean and quality improvement fit the organizational strategy, and understand their specific role in continuous improvement. Berwick stresses the need for hospital managers to trust hospital staff to ‘become citizens in the improvement of their own work’ (Berwick, 2003, p. 449). This is consistent with earlier research suggesting that health professionals sustain practices that make sense to them, make their work easier and/or improve patient care (Timmons et al., 2014). Widely communicated on how the organization will achieve high- quality care through continuous improvement at points of care.

Title: A visual exploration of melodic relationships within traditional music collections
Word count: 3791
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to discuss a technique for visually exploring melodic relationships within traditional tune collections encoded in abc notation, a widely used text-based music representation system particularly popular for folk and traditional music. There are approximately ½ million melodies encoded in abc on the web and abcnotation.com provides a searchable index of the entire corpus with tools to view, download and listen to the scores.   This paper stems from related work known as TuneGraph which uses a melodic similarity measure to derive a proximity graph representing relationships between tunes in the abc corpus, and which allows users of abcnotation.com to explore melodic similarity. As it stands TuneGraph only gives a localised view of the melodic relationships: this paper aims to look at exploring those relationships at a global (corpus-based) level via a prototype visualisation tool. Currently the tool is not interactive: in this paper the aim is to consider a proof-of-concept approach to explore where there is a useful visualisation possible; future work will look at user interactivity with the tool

basic summary: The corpus graph G(V, E) is constructed as discussed, with edges in E only included between pairs of vertices if the corresponding tunes are sufficiently similar. This restricted graph is referred to henceforth as the corpus graph, (also referred to as the fundamental proximity graph in ). In this graph each vertex represents a tune and edge weights represent similarities between tunes: the greater the similarity the larger the edge weight. In the sparse proximity graph is sparsified further and processed to produce a collection of local tune graphs, one for each connected vertex in the graph. TuneGraph uses a similarity measure to derive a proximity graph representing similarities within the abc notation corpus (~½ million tunes) which backs the search engine.

sim_matrix summary: 1(l) for T = 1/8, the  methodology has done well at disambiguating the tune families:  generally vertices of the same colour (in the same family) are  clustered closely together even if no visible edge connects them  (recall that zero-weight edges, which are not shown, are used to  connect the graph and connect tunes to their most similar  neighbour even though the two tunes are not considered  sufficiently similar to have that similarity represented in the  graph). Specifically an  edge between vertices Vx and Vy is only included if   S(X,Y) ≥ average(length(X), length(Y)) * T  Following [1] values for T in the experiments are 1/4, 1/6 and  1/8; the former value considerably restricts the number of edges  whilst the latter is fairly inclusive and can allow a lot of false  positive matches.

Obviously a disconnected  component may have many vertices which are not quite similar  enough to be connected to other components in the original  proximity graph and probably only one of these will end up  being connected. Unfortunately, in the context of a proximity graph, such a  scheme potentially discards a lot of valuable information:  although two vertices may not be connected because the  corresponding tunes are not sufficiently similar, nonetheless it is  possible to measure the similarity between them and use that to  inform the visualisation.

Title: Sustainable supply and demand chain integration within global manufacturing industries
Word count: 3397
Abstract: Given the emerging industrial management strategies considering three pillars of sustainability in particular, there is a vital need to determine the differences of sustainability practices within both supply and demand distribution systems through global manufacturing environments providing with the successful global trade and logistics. This research paper aims to explore the interactions and advantages of sustainability applications within both supply and demand chain management. The research framework adopted consists of survey questionnaire method which is conducted within a global tyre manufacturing company. The research results and analysis justify the need for the application of ethical codes, supply chain transformation and the effective association of industry executives, professional bodies and the government. The research study also identifies that the vital incentive factors for the organisation towards sustainable supply demand chain (SSDC) are mostly the financial benefits of doing so and therefore, a positive mind-set shift towards greening practices is required

Title: A novel method to determine dynamic temperature trends applied to in-shoe temperature data during walking
Word count: 2663
Abstract: Body temperature is one of the fundamental measures considered in the assessment of health and wellbeing, with various medical conditions known to give rise to abnormal changes in temperature.   In particular, abnormal variations in dynamic temperature patterns during walking or exercise may be linked to a range of foot problems, which are of particular concern in diabetic patients.  A number of studies have investigated normative temperature patterns of a population by considering data from multiple participants and averaging results after an acclimatisation interval. In this work we demonstrate that the temperature patterns obtained using such an approach may not be truly representative of temperature changes in a population, and the averaging process adopted may yield skewed results.  In this work we propose an alternative approach to determine generic reference temperature patterns based on a minimization of root mean square differences between time-shifted versions of temperature data collected from multiple participants. The results obtained indicate that this approach can yield a general trend that is more representative of actual temperature changes across a population than conventional averaging methods. The method we propose is also shown to better capture and link the effects of underlying factors that influence dynamic temperature trends, which could in turn lead to a better understanding of underlying physiological phenomena

basic summary: 2 shows the original temperature data for male and female participants together with the overall average and standard deviation using the standard averaging approach typically adopted in the literature. The RMSD approach proposed above was tested on in- shoe temperature measurements and the results obtained were compared to those from conventional temperature trends obtained by simple averaging procedures. Using the proposed method, all of the data captured is plotted with time, thus all of the different aspects of the data can be characterised using one model. CONCLUSION Temperature changes for medical investigations are typically conducted by computing the mean of the number of data sessions captured over the particular time period. considered the mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values in their investigation of the effect of ambient temperature and age on foot temperature. The acquired temperature data is averaged and the mean value with time, together with maximum and minimum or standard deviation are determined. The mean and standard deviation of the acquired data across participants are then used to characterize normal temperature values.

In this work we propose an alternative approach to determine generic reference temperature patterns based on a minimization of root mean square differences between time- shifted versions of temperature data collected from multiple participants. However, it is clear that initial temperature conditions vary widely across participants, even after the acclimatisation interval, leading to an average trend with high standard deviations at each time point.

frequency summary: Using the proposed method,  all of the data captured from the different subjects or sources  can be considered from one plot as well as its different trends  which could be due to the different source from where the  data is being captured. This proposed approach of applying the RMSD to a set of  captured data and then plotting the matched trends could be  applied to any data captured from different subjects or  scenarios over a period of time. Therefore, in plotting data with time using the method  proposed in this paper, one would be obtaining a more  informative pattern than when plotting data using the  conventional mean approach. Using the proposed method, all of the  data captured is plotted with time, thus all of the different  aspects of the data can be characterised using one model. An  array of RMSD values,  𝑅(𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑡0), is thus obtained where:  𝑅(𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑡0) = √ ∑ (𝑦𝑖(𝑡) − 𝑦𝑗(𝑡 − 𝑡0))2 𝑡2 𝑡=𝑡1 𝑁           (1)  for 𝑖=1, …, 𝐾 and 𝑗=1, …, 𝐾 (𝑖 ≠ 𝑗), where 𝐾 represents the  total number of acquired signals (across sessions and  participants). Once again, plotting the mean for  analysis only allows the researcher to analyze the influence  of one factor on the captured data at a time, which for the  data being considered would consist of the effect of gender  on the change in foot temperature as shown in Fig. METHOD  In order to determine normative temperature trends across  participants for a particular task, we propose a method based  on a minimization of the root mean square difference  (RMSD) between the available temperature recordings  which could potentially include multiple sessions, multiple  participants, and other influencing factors.

Title: Data on the annual aggregated income taxes of the Italian municipalities over the quinquennium 2007–2011
Word count: 1087
Abstract: This dataset contains the annual aggregated income taxes of all the Italian municipalities over the years 2007–2011. Data are clustered over the Italian regions and provinces. The source of the data is the Italian Ministry of Economics and Finance. The administrative variations in Italy over the quinquennium have been taken into account. Data are useful to understand the economic structure of Italy at the microscopic level of municipalities. They can serve also for making comparisons between economical aspects and other features of the Italian cities.Peer-reviewedPublisher Versio

Title: Non-human gaming
Word count: 543
Abstract: In this talk, I will critically analyse the rise of video games that require limited human intervention to be played. Idle games such as Cookie Clicker and Adventure Capitalist, games made by algorithms such as No Man’s Sky, the programming of AI to play games such as Screeps, Drivatars and ghost cars in racing games, all suggest that human beings are becoming peripheral in the act of playing and in the definition of video games. Drawing on Sonia Fizek’s analysis of Slavoj Zizek and Robert Pfaller’s concept of interpassivity, and on studies on gamification and self-tracking, I will argue that Non-Human Gaming is not necessarily an exception to oppose to ‘standard’ video games, or a temporary trend. I will argue that the non-human has always been haunting the medium, and that studies on interactivity, agency, and player’s competences have been providing, so far, a comforting perspective that places the human at the centre. In fact, Non-Human Gaming is an adequate response to the disappearance of life from Earth – as it has been imagined, feared, and prophesised by scientists in the last few decades. Alexander Galloway’s concept of video games as allegories of life will be deployed to argue that digital games are transforming into living things, which could entirely replace human players and play by themselves. From this perspective, video games might be seen in relation to the rise of self-driving cars, algorithmic trade exchange, and remote warfare, which could be functioning by themselves after human extinction. Roger Caillois, in his early work on mimicry and mythology, was already prefiguring a similar hypothesis: living beings develop forms of dispersal and waste of energy (of which games are an example) that cannot be explained through a rationalistic view on evolution and species preservation, but are nonetheless defining characteristics of life

Title: Reasoning and learning services for coalition situational understanding
Word count: 3947
Abstract: Situational understanding requires an ability to assess the current situation and anticipate future situations, requiring both pattern recognition and inference. A coalition involves multiple agencies sharing information and analytics. This paper considers how to harness distributed information sources, including multimodal sensors, together with machine learning and reasoning services, to perform situational understanding in a coalition context. To exemplify the approach we focus on a technology integration experiment in which multimodal data — including video and still imagery, geospatial and weather data — is processed and fused in a service-oriented architecture by heterogeneous pattern recognition and inference components. We show how the architecture: (i) provides awareness of the current situation and prediction of future states, (ii) is robust to individual service failure, (iii) supports the generation of ‘why’ explanations for human analysts (including from components based on ‘black box’ deep neural networks which pose particular challenges to explanation generation), and (iv) allows for the imposition of information sharing constraints in a coalition context where there is varying levels of trust between partner agencies

basic summary: Once these services are made available to the system, the system itself can autonomously make a decision as to which model is most appropriate. This paper considers how to harness distributed information sources, including multimodal sensors, together with machine learning and reasoning services, to perform situational understanding in a coalition context. 4.2 Congestion Reasoner As shown in Figure 3, the congestion reasoner involves an integration of multiple services and data sources. In our instantiated system, this occurs between the congestion classifier model and the congestion reasoner service.

Sections 4 and 5 give a summary of two pieces of previous work in the domain of traffic congestion detection that, taken together, offer a coalition system for the detection of current traffic congestion (insight) and models for the prediction of future congestion (foresight) respectively. Furthermore, as we ensured that the system architecture we developed remained decoupled from the specific problem, our final system can be used as a template for approaching other CSU problems by simply exchanging the data sources and services related to the congestion space to ones relevant to alternative CSU problems. In our system, the object detector used in this interpretability technique already existed within our coalition of services as it was created as part of the congestion reasoner service chain.

Title: Metal-free selective mono-halodecarboxylation of heteroarenes under mild conditions
Word count: 2157
Abstract: The halodecarboxylation of heteroarene carboxylic acids by treatment with N-bromosuccinimide or N-chlorosuccinimide was performed. This procedure provides a convenient route to synthetically useful mono-halogenated heteroarene intermediates such as halo-indoles, -aza-indoles, -indazoles and -aza-indazoles. The mild conditions employed and simple protocol provides an advantage over traditional halodecarboxylation procedures that require expensive and toxic metal catalysts, basic conditions, time-consuming intermediate isolation and elevated reaction temperatures

Title: Circular Convolution Filter Bank Multicarrier (FBMC) System with Index Modulation
Word count: 3414
Abstract: Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with index modulation (OFDM-IM), which uses the subcarrier indices as a source of information, has attracted considerable interest recently. Motivated by the index modulation (IM) concept, we build a circular convolution filter bank multicarrier with index modulation (C-FBMC-IM) system in this paper. The advantages of the C-FBMC-IM system are investigated by comparing the interference power with the conventional C-FBMC system. As some subcarriers carry nothing but zeros, the minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalization bias power will be smaller comparing to the conventional C-FBMC system. As a result, our C-FBMC-IM system outperforms the conventional C-FBMC system. The simulation results demonstrate that both BER and spectral efficiency improvement can be achieved when we apply IM into the C-FBMC system

Title: Estimating distemper virus dynamics among wolves and grizzly bears using serology and Bayesian state‐space models
Word count: 5838
Abstract: Many parasites infect multiple hosts, but estimating the transmission across host species remains a key challenge in disease ecology. We investigated the within and across host species dynamics of canine distemper virus (CDV) in grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) and wolves (Canis lupus) of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE). We hypothesized that grizzly bears may be more likely to be exposed to CDV during outbreaks in the wolf population because grizzly bears often displace wolves while scavenging carcasses. We used serological data collected from 1984 to 2014 in conjunction with Bayesian state‐space models to infer the temporal dynamics of CDV. These models accounted for the unknown timing of pathogen exposure, and we assessed how different testing thresholds and the potential for testing errors affected our conclusions. We identified three main CDV outbreaks (1999, 2005, and 2008) in wolves, which were more obvious when we used higher diagnostic thresholds to qualify as seropositive. There was some evidence for increased exposure rates in grizzly bears in 2005, but the magnitude of the wolf effect on bear exposures was poorly estimated and depended upon our prior distributions. Grizzly bears were exposed to CDV prior to wolf reintroduction and during time periods outside of known wolf outbreaks, thus wolves are only one of several potential routes for grizzly bear exposures. Our modeling approach accounts for several of the shortcomings of serological data and is applicable to many wildlife disease systems, but is most informative when testing intervals are short. CDV circulates in a wide range of carnivore species, but it remains unclear whether the disease persists locally within the GYE carnivore community or is periodically reintroduced from distant regions with larger host populations

This  is closely  related  to a complementary  log–log model used  for  interval- censored survival analyses (Heisey et al., 2010; Prentice &  Gloeckler, 1978).All models  investigated  converged  well, and based on DIC, models that included an effect of wolf expo- sure on bear exposure hazards generally performed better  (i.e., had  lower DIC) than models that assumed independent exposure hazards  between the two host species, or that there was an effect of bear ex- posure on wolf exposure (Table 1).For  example,  there  are  likely  differ- ences among laboratories; the timing of the infection is known only  to an interval (e.g., from birth to the date of the first sample); and op- timal threshold values for distinguishing between positive and nega- tives tests may be unknown (Gilbert et al., 2013).In our analyses,  the magnitude of the wolf effect on bears depended on our prior  distributions, suggesting the data were not particularly informa- tive about cross- species transmission due to more severe interval  censoring in the bear disease data (Supporting Information Figure  S1) and the limited number of outbreaks in wolves.There was no direct information on sensitivity or specificity in  this analysis, but the model deviance may decline  if an  individual’s  test status can be “re- assigned” as a potential testing error and al- lowing the transmission parameter either within or across species to  remain high (or low).Despite relatively long time series and a state- space hierarchi- cal model,  it  remained difficult  to assess correlations  in  the dis- ease dynamics among host species, which is an initial step in the  direction of estimating the amount of cross- species transmission.The es- timated slope of the relationship between wolf and bear infections,  α1, increased as we included more uncertainty into the model, either  by including potential testing errors or by using more diffuse prior  distributions (Figure 5).For pathogens with fast growth rates like CDV, an alternative ap- proach to assessing the directionality of transmission may be to  assess whether  the  infections  in one  species occur  prior  to  the  second host species using shorter windows of time (e.g., weekly  or  monthly).

Title: Optical Asymmetric Modulation for VLC Systems
Word count: 3614
Abstract: The explosive growth of connected devices and the increasing number of broadband users have led to an unprecedented growth in traffic demand. To this effect, the next generation wireless systems are envisioned to meet this growth and offer a potential data rate of 10 Gbps or more. In this context, an attractive solution to the current spectrum crunch issue is to exploit the visible light spectrum for the realization of high-speed commutation systems. However, this requires solutions to certain challenges relating to visible light communications (VLC), such as the stringent requirements of VLC-based intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD), which require signals to be real and unipolar. The present work proposes a novel power-domain multiplexing based optical asymmetric modulation (OAM) scheme for indoor VLC systems, which is particularly adapted to transmit high-order modulation signals using linear real and unipolar constellations that fit into the restrictions of IM/DD systems. It is shown that the proposed scheme provides improved system performance that outperforms alternative modulation schemes, at no extra complexity

basic summary: CONCLUSION We proposed a novel optical asymmetric modulation (OAM) scheme to facilitate the efficient transmission of high order modulation signals over VLC channels. The main characteristic of the proposed scheme is its low hardware complexity, where a high-order modulation is realized using a single transmitting LED and a single receiving PD. It is shown that the proposed scheme provides improved system performance that outperforms alternative modulation schemes at no extra complexity. SYSTEM AND CHANNEL MODEL A generic indoor VLC system is considered where the proposed OAM is realized by means of a single transmitting LED and a single receiving PD. The present contribution proposes a novel optical asymmet- ric modulation (OAM) scheme that is capable of enabling high-rate transmission in indoor VLC systems. VLC is a small-cell technology that exploits the unregu- lated visible light spectrum for short-range data transmission using intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD).

Title: Geostatistical models using remotely-sensed data predict savanna tsetse decline across the interface between protected and unprotected areas in Serengeti, Tanzania
Word count: 6251
Abstract: 1.Monitoring abundance is essential for vector management, but it is often only possible in a fraction of managed areas. For vector control programs, sampling to estimate abundance is usually carried out at a local-scale (10s km2), while interventions often extend across 100s km2. Geostatistical models have been used to interpolate between points where data are available, but this still requires costly sampling across the entire area of interest. Instead, we used geostatistical models to predict local-scale spatial variation in the abundance of tsetse – vectors of human and animal African trypanosomes - beyond the spatial extent of data to which models were fitted, in Serengeti, Tanzania.  2.We sampled Glossina swynnertoni and G. pallidipes &gt;10 km inside the Serengeti National Park (SNP) and along four transects extending into areas where humans and livestock live. We fitted geostatistical models to data &gt;10 km inside the SNP to produce maps of abundance for the entire region, including unprotected areas.  3.Inside the SNP, the mean number of G. pallidipes caught per trap per day in dense woodland was 166 (± 24 SE), compared to 3 (± 1) in grassland. G. swynnertoni was more homogenous with respective means of 15 (± 3) and 15 (± 8). In general, models predicted a decline in abundance from protected to unprotected areas, related to anthropogenic changes to vegetation, which was confirmed during field survey.  4.Synthesis and applications. Our approach allows vector control managers to identify sites predicted to have relatively high tsetse abundance, and therefore to design and implement improved surveillance strategies. In East and Southern Africa, trypanosomiasis is associated with wilderness areas. Our study identified pockets of vegetation which could sustain tsetse populations in farming areas outside the Serengeti National Park. Our method will assist countries in identifying, monitoring and, if necessary, controlling tsetse in trypanosomiasis foci. This has specific application to tsetse, but the approach could also be developed for vectors of other pathogens

Inside the protected area, the predicted abundance was >100, but within 5 km into unprotected areas, the predicted abundance was <10. Data from: Geostatistical models using remotely- sensed data predict savanna tsetse decline across the interface between pro- tected and unprotected areas in Serengeti, Tanzania. Although the abundance of G. swynnertoni was more homogenous between vegetation types than G. pallidipes, models still predicted a decline in numbers from protected to unprotected areas. In general, the models fitted to data >10 km inside the SNP, predicted a decline in tsetse abundance across the interface. Our mod- els explained, in part, this observed decline in tsetse abundance, but predicted tsetse to be present in numbers >100 in some unprotected areas. We fitted geostatistical models to data >10 km inside the SNP to produce maps of abundance for the entire region, including unprotected areas. It may be anticipated that regions adjacent to protected areas are subject to relatively high numbers of tsetse dispersing from inside pro- tected areas. (a) Glossina pallidipes observed; (b) Glossina swynnertoni observed; (c) G. pallidipes predicted; (d) G. swynnertoni predicted; (e) G. pallidipes residuals; and (f) G. swynnertoni residuals. Models should then be tested by selecting areas predicted to support relatively high vs. low abundance and these sites subject to tsetse surveillance. In general, models predicted a decline in abundance from protected to unprotected areas, re- lated to anthropogenic changes to vegetation, which was confirmed during field survey. We quantified mean daily numbers of tsetse caught in traps as a function of vegetation type, for areas >10 km inside the Serengeti National Park (SNP), Tanzania. Our study identified pockets of vegetation which could sustain tsetse populations in farming areas outside the 1998 | Journal of Applied Ecology LORD et aL. However, our models highlight there may be regions outside protected areas where vegetation is still sufficient to support tsetse populations. Application of these vector control methods over large and remote protected areas is not feasible, but control can be targeted in interface areas to reduce human and livestock exposure.

Extensive grid- based sampling of  tsetse using  traps  to estimate  abundance coupled with vegetation mapping using remotely- sensed  data  has  previously  been  applied  to  inform  tsetse  control  (Albert  et al.,  2015;  Dicko  et al.,  2014;  Hendrickx  et al.,  1999).

A  better  under- standing  of  trypanosome  transmission  dynamics  and  approaches  to  improve  control  are  current  priorities  for  these  regions  (Auty  et al.,  2016; Diall et al., 2017). Allowing  for  savanna  tsetse  daily  dispersal  rates  (Hargrove,  1981),  a  buffer  of  500 m  around  each  trap was  used  to  calculate  the average LST, Landsat Band 7, NDVI and elevation. To determine  the significance of  the difference  in  log- transformed  abundance  observed  between  vegetation  types  for  each  species,  we  used  ANOVA  followed  by  the  Tukey  Honest  Significant Difference  test  (Tukey HSD). To compensate for this,  daily  catches  (y)  from  3 days  for  each  trap  were  transformed  to  log10(y + 1)  before  calculation  of mean  numbers  per  trap  per  day  and SE. For  G. pallidipes,  the  model,  using  remotely- sensed  data,  with  the  lowest  log- CPO  score  included  all  the  environmental  variables  (Table 1). org/10.1371/journal.pone.0011809 Mweempwa,  C., Marcotty,  T.,  De  Pus,  C.,  Penzhorn,  B.

Title: Antimicrobial activity of per acetic acid for trans-operative disinfection of endodontic files
Word count: 3399
Abstract: Reducing the accumulation of microorganisms on an endodontic file during endodontic treatment is important to limit recontamination of the root canal and increase likelihood of successful treatment outcome. Objective: To compare the antimicrobial activity of peracetic acid (PA), isopropyl alcohol and acetone against a range of bacteria and also for disinfection of contaminated endodontic K-files. Material and Methods: Antimicrobial activities of PA, isopropyl alcohol and acetone were compared against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, vancomycin resistant E. faecalis (VRE) and meticillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA), using minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and time-kill assays. Test solutions at different exposure times (15 s and 30 s) were assessed for treatment of endodontic files acting as carriers of E. faecalis-contaminated dental debris. Results: All bacteria were susceptible to PA (MBC range 0.25-1%), acetone (MBC range 50-60%) and isopropyl alcohol (30-40%). Using a time-kill assay of the antimicrobials at the determined MBC, all test microorganisms, with the exception of E. faecalis (VRE) 7766 were killed after 15 s exposure. In the case of E. faecalis 7766, viable cells remained detectable after 120 s exposure to acetone. Testing disinfection of endodontic K-files, previously coated with dental debris containing E. faecalis, it was found that PA (2%) completely killed E. faecalis after 15 s exposure. However, even after 30 s exposure, isopropyl alcohol (80%) and acetone (80%) had limited disinfecting activity. Conclusion: Extrapolation of these results to clinical practice would suggest that PA would be the most effective agent for trans-operative disinfection of endodontic K-files during treatment of a single patient

basic summary: Antimicrobial activity of Isopropyl Alcohol (80%), Acetone (80%) and Peracetic acid (2%) on K-files (carrier test) contaminated with E. faecalis grown in biofilms on dentin matrix (percentage of elimination). Objective: To compare the antimicrobial activi ty of peracetic acid (PA), isopropyl alcohol and acetone against a range of bacteria and also for disinfection of contaminated endodontic K-files. In this study, sessile E. faecalis removed from dentine walls by K-files used in the carrier test, exhibited resistance to acetone and isopropyl alcohol after 30 s exposure. Table.2: Disinfectant activity (time kill assay) after exposure to acetone (97%), isopropyl alcohol (98%) and peracetic acid (2%). Testing disinfection of endodontic K- files, previously coated with dental debris containing E. faecalis, it was found that PA (2%) completely killed E. faecalis after 15 s exposure. Test solutions at different exposure times (15 s and 30 s) were assessed for treatment of endodontic files acting as carriers of E. faecalis-contaminated dental debris. In these experiments, exposure to isopropyl alcohol for 30 s was more effective than for acetone (p<0.05, chi-square test). Contact with acetone, isopropyl alcohol, or 2% PA resulted in a total kill (<3.3×102 CFU/ml; minimum level of detection of viable cells in this assay) after 15 s exposure. Whilst isopropyl alcohol and acetone are ineffective at killing bacterial spores, maintenance of decontamination of instruments by vegetative organisms should be achievable by these agents . MATERIAL AND METHODS Test solutions used were 2% peracetic acid (PA) (SekuseptTMAktiv - Henkel AG & Co. KGaA, Düsseldorf, DE), acetone (>97%) and isopropyl alcohol/isopropanol (>98%).

sim_matrix summary: Assessment of     disinfection and  sterilization processes in dental practice as an  important factors in prevention of infections. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate and  compare the antimicrobial activity of PA, isopropyl  alcohol (isopropanol) and acetone (propanone) against  a  range of bacteria and also for the disinfection of  contaminated endodontic K-files. Chemical  disinfection and antiseptics – Quantitative  suspension test for the evaluation of bacterial  activity of chemical disinfectants and antiseptics  used in food, industrial, domestic and institutional  areas – Test method and requirements (phase 2, step  1) Brussels: European Committee for  Standardization 1997. Significantly,  total elimination of microbial viability occurred with  sessile cells derived from dentinal matrices for all K-file  carriers (100%) after 15 s exposure[25-27].PA is an  oxidizing agent used in the decontamination of a wide  range of medical equipment as well as in food and water  treatment processes10. During  single endodontic therapy, residual material can  accumulate on the working surface of an endodontic  instrument and maintenance of effective instrument  disinfection during the treatment session is an important  consideration[8,9]. Material and Methods:  Antimicrobial activities of PA, isopropyl alcohol and  acetone were compared against Staphylococcus aureus,  Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas  aeruginosa, vancomycin resistant E. faecalis (VRE) and  meticillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA), using minimum  bactericidal concentration (MBC) and time-kill assays. V. CONCLUSION  Based on the study findings, it was concluded that PA  was the most effective of the test disinfectants and as such  is advocated as an appropriate disinfectant for single use  endodontic instruments during use in a single treatment  session. A reduction in bacterial  viability higher than 105 CFU/ml was observed for all test  solutions, indicating that the chemicals had adequate  disinfecting activity for planktonically grown Gram- negative and Gram-positive bacteria after exposure for 15  s. The only exception was VRE 7766 which, by time kill  assay, demonstrated a residual number of viable cells  (2.3× 104 CFU/mL) after exposure of ~1011 CFU/ml to  concentrated acetone[16,17,22,23]. Experimental  evaluation of cyclic fatigue resistance of four  different nickel-titanium instruments after  immersion in sodium hypochlorite and/or  sterilization. A 100-µL volume of  double strength tryptone sodium chloride (TSC; 1g/L  Tryptone (Difco), sodium chloride (Merck) 8.5g/L) was  then added as a neutralizingagent, bacterial viability was  then determined by plating 10 µL portions of serial  decimally diluted preparations in TSC on to an  appropriate agar media and incubating for 24-48 h at  37oC.

Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 (OD660nm=0.5, 100-µL) was inoculated into the test tubes to generate a biofilm on the dentinal surfaces [15]. Material and Methods: Antimicrobial activities of PA, isopropyl alcohol and acetone were compared against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, vancomycin resistant E. faecalis (VRE) and meticillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA), using minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and time-kill assays. Although stated as disinfectants [22], to our knowledge, relatively few reports have tested the sensitivity of bacteria to both isopropyl alcohol and acetone, motivating inclusion of these agents in comparable tests with PA. This was particularly evident when contaminated K-files were dried prior to exposure to the disinfectant, even at higher concentrations. Moreover, isopropyl alcohol-based hand antiseptics have demonstrated higher activity against E. coli, Micrococcus luteus, and S. aureus than ethanol-based disinfectants in experiments on skin surfaces[27]. This recalcitrance of biofilms makes them extremely difficult to treat[23]. Contact with acetone, isopropyl alcohol, or 2% PA resulted in a total kill (<3.3×102 CFU/ml; minimum level of detection of viable cells in this assay) after 15 s exposure. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antimicrobial activity of PA, isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol) and acetone (propanone) against a range of bacteria and also for the disinfection of contaminated endodontic K-files. The approaches used to clean endodontic instruments are generally ineffective for the removal of biological debris, and therefore, single use instruments are advocated to avoid cross-infection occurring between patients6.

Title: Types of Scientific Collaborators: A Perspective of Author Contribution Network
Word count: 1043
Abstract: The purpose of this study is to investigate interaction between collaborators within individual studies by measuring how they made contributions to their studies. Author contribution network is constructed based on the author contribution statements of 140,000 full-text articles in PloS by viewing every collaborator as a node and a shared contribution as an edge. Three types of contributors are identified: general team-players, factotums, and mavericks. The preliminary result suggests that division of labor widely exists in scientific re-search and the latter two types of collaborators are common in small teams

basic summary: 4 Conclusion This study utilizes the author contribution statements embedded in full-text articles to build an author contribution network for every single study. 2.3 Three types of collaborators Based on the constructed author contribution network, three types of collaborators are exemplified in Fig. In an author contribution network, factotums, thus, are the nodes with both self- looped edge(s) and edge(s) connected to other node(s) (e.g., C2). It also suggests that most collaborators in research teams are team-players, who share tasks; then follow the factotums; and, lastly mavericks are least common collaborators.

Title: A Study of the Intellectual Structure of Community Archives
Word count: 1460
Abstract: Community archives have gained renewed attention as an emerging archival movement. The goal of this study is to map the intellectual structure of community-centric archival research during the 2000-2017 period. To identify and visualize the relationships between topics within the subject areas, we analyzed the co-occurrence index and network structures of keywords derived from titles, abstracts, and author-provided keywords in peer-reviewed journal articles and conference proceedings in the field of community archives

To aid us in this  search, we used the following search terms when searching the databases: community  archive(s), non-institutional archive(s), participatory archive(s), grassroots archive(s),  activist archive(s), autonomous archive(s), ethnic archive(s), oral history archive(s),  and local history project(s). The 2006-2011 period data, with 148 nodes and 4,068 edges, reveals a growing pres- ence of indigenous perspectives and cultural diversity in the literature as seen in the  emergence of terms like “indigenous people” and “queer archive.” Further, this period  marked the rise of research on non-traditional archival materials as represented by the  terms “music archive,” “film,” “sound archive,” and “audiovisual archive.” We also  observed that the term “community archive” has moved to the core of the network since  this period (degree of centrality: 10 -> 128 -> 466).

Title: Toward an Understanding of Data Literacy
Word count: 1427
Abstract: As the interest in data grows, much attention has been paid to data literacy, and multiple perspectives and understandings to define data literacy have emerged from varying conceptual contexts. However, there remains a lack of agreement regarding the scope of data literacy across disciplines. This study attempts to define data literacy holistically through a meta-synthesis approach. The study found three distinct themes for data literacy: as skills required for data-driven decision making, as activities for research data services, and a set of practices for data lifecycle
basic similarity: 0.7028641348196903
basic summary: Such activities and practices include data creation, data acquisition, data normalization, data analytics, data storage, data disposal, and data use/re-use. The primary search terms used to locate relevant articles were any derivative forms of data – i.e., data, big data, research data, etc. As the interest in data grows, much attention has been paid to data literacy, and multiple perspectives and understandings to define data literacy have emerged from varying conceptual contexts. This defini- tion of data literacy considers a set activities and practices undertaken in the production, consumption, and management of data through the data lifecycle.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.6245770943604572
sim_matrix summary: (2011)  Components of data literacy competency include: “discovery and ac- quisition; databases and data formats; data conversion and interopera- bility; data processing and analysis; data visualization and representa- tion; data management & organization; data quality and documentation;  metadata and description; cultures of practice; ethics & attribution; data  curation and re-use; and data preservation.”  Matthews (2016) “…a set of practical competencies situated in a wider context of per- sonal and social goals, as well as challenges such as subjectivity and  bias.”   Maybee & Zilinski  (2015)  Comprised of “skills related to accessing, managing, communicating,  preserving and ethically using data.”  4  Okamoto (2017) “…The ability to access, critically assess, interpret, manipulate, man- age, summarize, handle, present, and ethically use data.”   4 Conclusion  The preliminary results of the meta-synthesis reveal that data literacy has multiple fac- ets and is applied with reference to its actions, objective, and context. Data literacy as activities supporting research data services  Koltay (2016) “…Is closely related to research data services that include research data  management.”   Prado & Marzal  (2013)   “…Enables individuals to access, interpret, critically assess, manage,  handle and ethically use data.”   Qin & D’Ignazio  (2010)  “…Knowledge and skills in collecting, processing, managing, evaluat- ing, and using data for scientific inquiry.”  Searle et al. (2015)    Identified as “one of the research data service activities that support  researchers in building the skills and knowledge required to manage  data well.”  3.3 Data Literacy as a Set of Practices for Data Lifecycle  The last definition is a combination of the two definitions discussed so far. (2017)        “…Data literate reader has the ability to properly evaluate the evidence  that is presented in these scenarios, so that they can make critical judg- ments on the reliability of the information presented and can better un- derstand how their own contributed data is being utilized and make  more informed decisions.”   3  3.2 Data Literacy as Activities Supporting Research Data Services  Since the emergence of e-science and cyberinfrastructure, data literacy has been  recognized as one of the critical building blocks in the knowledge base of information  professionals involved in supporting research data management and curation (Koltay,  2016).

(2011)  Components of data literacy competency include: “discovery and ac- quisition; databases and data formats; data conversion and interopera- bility; data processing and analysis; data visualization and representa- tion; data management & organization; data quality and documentation;  metadata and description; cultures of practice; ethics & attribution; data  curation and re-use; and data preservation.”  Matthews (2016) “…a set of practical competencies situated in a wider context of per- sonal and social goals, as well as challenges such as subjectivity and  bias.”   Maybee & Zilinski  (2015)  Comprised of “skills related to accessing, managing, communicating,  preserving and ethically using data.”  4  Okamoto (2017) “…The ability to access, critically assess, interpret, manipulate, man- age, summarize, handle, present, and ethically use data.”   4 Conclusion  The preliminary results of the meta-synthesis reveal that data literacy has multiple fac- ets and is applied with reference to its actions, objective, and context. (2017)        “…Data literate reader has the ability to properly evaluate the evidence  that is presented in these scenarios, so that they can make critical judg- ments on the reliability of the information presented and can better un- derstand how their own contributed data is being utilized and make  more informed decisions.”   3  3.2 Data Literacy as Activities Supporting Research Data Services  Since the emergence of e-science and cyberinfrastructure, data literacy has been  recognized as one of the critical building blocks in the knowledge base of information  professionals involved in supporting research data management and curation (Koltay,  2016). Data literacy as activities supporting research data services  Koltay (2016) “…Is closely related to research data services that include research data  management.”   Prado & Marzal  (2013)   “…Enables individuals to access, interpret, critically assess, manage,  handle and ethically use data.”   Qin & D’Ignazio  (2010)  “…Knowledge and skills in collecting, processing, managing, evaluat- ing, and using data for scientific inquiry.”  Searle et al.

Title: Creating A Disability Corpus for Literary Analysis: Pilot Classification Experiments
Word count: 1350
Abstract: As literary text opens to researchers for distant reading, the computational analysis of large corpora of text for literary scholarship, problems beyond typical data science roadblocks, such as data scale and statistical significance of findings have emerged. For scholars studying character and social representation in literature, the identification of characters within the given classes of study is crucial, painstaking, and often a manual process. However, for characters with disabilities, manual identification is prohibitively difficult to undertake at scale, and especially challenging given the coded textual markers that can be used to refer to disability. There currently exists no corpus of characters in fiction with disabilities, which is the first step to at-scale computational study of this topic. This project seeks to pilot a classification process using manually assigned ground truth on a subset of volumes from the HathiTrust. Having successfully built and evaluated a Naïve Bayes classifier, we suggest full-scale deployment of a statistical classifier on a large corpus of literature in order to assemble a disability corpus. This project also covers preliminary exploratory textual analysis of characters with disabilities to yield potential research questions for further exploration

basic summary: This yielded a final dataset with a total of 119 characters, including 7,079 words for characters with disabilities and 5,819 words for characters without. This project is focused on using distant reading techniques to identify and study characters with disabilities in fiction, a relatively unexplored area of study, and one with unique challenges. Characters with disabilities have an average sentiment 2.5 times more negative than characters without. 2 Methods Using manual identification of characters with disabilities, we compiled a list of 28 novels that had at least one character with a disability. This pilot project and any resulting corpus could also serve as a first step to finer-grained identification of characters with disabilities in literature. For scholars studying character and social representation in literature, the identification of characters within the given classes of study is crucial, painstaking, and often a manual process. There currently exists no corpus of characters in fiction with disabilities, which is the first step to at-scale computational study of this topic.

Abstract: In the recent report Engage to Excel,1 President Obama’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) identifies mathematics as a bottleneck in undergraduate Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education. Among PCAST’s recommendations are onescalling for the development and teaching of college-level mathematics courses “by faculty from mathematics-intensive disciplines other than mathematics” and for “a new pathway for producing K–12 mathematics teachers…in programs in mathematics-intensive fields other than mathematics.”2 While we are in sharp disagreement with these specific recommendations, we do share PCAST’s concern for the state of STEM education. We encourage the mathematicscommunity to focus constructively on the broad view the report sketches. We appeal to the community to amplify its communications with other STEM disciplines, to publicize its teaching innovations, and to redouble its efforts to meet the challenges discussed by PCAST

basic summary: In order to reach as many students as possible, education in entry-level college mathematics must continue to evolve. Mathematicians guide students to explore their ideas using skills that apply beyond immediate problems; we facilitate students’ efforts to understand the principles and logic that underpin applications. We firmly assert that it is essential that mathemati- cians be actively engaged in the planning and teaching of the mathematics courses that form the foundation of STEM education. A solid foundation in mathematics is essential for successful STEM education, for this paves the way for flexibility in a changing workforce environment.

Title: Measurement of the parity violating asymmetry in the quasielastic electron-deuteron scattering and improved determination of the magnetic strange form factor and the isovector anapole radiative correction
Word count: 3057
Abstract: A new measurement of the parity-violating asymmetry in the electron-deuteron quasielastic scattering for backward angles at ⟨Q[superscript 2]⟩=0.224 (GeV/c)[superscript 2], obtained in the A4 experiment at the Mainz Microtron accelerator (MAMI) facility, is presented. The measured asymmetry is A[subscript PV][superscript d]=(-20.11±0.87[subscript stat]±1.03[subscript sys])×10[superscript -6]. A combination of these data with the proton measurements of the parity-violating asymmetry in the A4 experiment yields a value for the effective isovector axial-vector form factor of G[subscript A][superscript e,(T=1)]=-0.19±0.43 and R[subscript A][superscript e(T=1),anap] =-0.41±0.35 for the anapole radiative correction. When combined with a reanalysis of measurements obtained in the G0 experiment at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, the uncertainties are further reduced to G[subscript M][superscript s]=0.17±0.11 for the magnetic strange form factors, and R[subscript A][superscript (T=1),anap]=-0.54±0.26.Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaf

The combination of the A4 results presented here with asymmetries measured previously in the A4 experiment [6,8], and with the asymmetries obtained in the G0 experiment at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility [9,10], leads to a substantial reduction of the experimental uncertainty for the values of Ge;ðT¼1ÞA and of G s M. The anapole radiative correction is extracted and compared to the theoretical calculations of Zhu et al. Here we present the analysis of a new measurement of the parity-violating asymmetry at hQ2i ¼ 0.224 ðGeV=cÞ2 and an average θ¯ ¼ 145°, obtained in the A4 experiment at the Mainz Microtron (MAMI). Future measurements of APV in the A4 experiment at Q2 ¼ 0.1 ðGeV=cÞ2 will help to further reduce the errors of GsM, G e;ðT¼1Þ A , G e;ðT¼0Þ A , R ðT¼1Þ;anap A and R ðT¼0Þ;anap A .

tfidf summary: The calculations of RðT¼iÞ;anapA are affected by large theoretical uncertainties related to the lack of knowledge about the parity-violating meson-nucleon couplings [2–4,15]. False asymmetries originate from helicity-correlated beam differences of energy, position, angle and intensity. AiPV shows no significant dependence on the azimuthal angle. Its effect, however, cannot be calculated using perturbative methods of the QCD theory.

Title: SNP Genotyping Defines Complex Gene-Flow Boundaries Among African Malaria Vector Mosquitoes
Word count: 3303
Abstract: Mosquitoes in the Anopheles gambiae complex show rapid ecological and behavioral diversification, traits that promote malaria transmission and complicate vector control efforts. A high-density, genome-wide mosquito SNP-genotyping array allowed mapping of genomic differentiation between populations and species that exhibit varying levels of reproductive isolation. Regions near centromeres or within polymorphic inversions exhibited the greatest genetic divergence, but divergence was also observed elsewhere in the genomes. Signals of natural selection within populations were overrepresented among genomic regions that are differentiated between populations, implying that differentiation is often driven by population-specific selective events. Complex genomic differentiation among speciating vector mosquito populations implies that tools for genome-wide monitoring of population structure will prove useful for the advancement of malaria eradication

Title: On the Green functions of gravitational radiation theory
Word count: 3184
Abstract: Previous work in the literature has studied gravitational radiation inblack-hole collisions at the speed of light. In particular, it had been provedthat the perturbative field equations may all be reduced to equations in onlytwo independent variables, by virtue of a conformal symmetry at each order inperturbation theory. The Green function for the perturbative field equations ishere analyzed by studying the corresponding second-order hyperbolic operatorwith variable coefficients, instead of using the reduction method from theretarded flat-space Green function in four dimensions. After reduction tocanonical form of this hyperbolic operator, the integral representation of thesolution in terms of the Riemann function is obtained. The Riemann functionsolves a characteristic initial-value problem for which analytic formulaeleading to the numerical solution are derived.Comment: 15 pages, plain Tex.

(3.4) The dependence of t on x and y is obtained implicitly by solving the system [6, 8] x = r + log ( t− 1 2 ) − 8 (t− 1) − 4 (3.5) y = r + log ( t+ 1 2 ) + 8 (t+ 1) − 4. 8 In the (x, y) variables, the operator Lm,n reads therefore Lm,n = f(x, y) ∂ 2 ∂x∂y + g(x, y) ∂ ∂x + h(x, y) ∂ ∂y + n2 −m2 (3.16) where, exploiting the formulae ∂x ∂q = 64 √ 2 (t− 1)2 (3.2b) ∂y ∂q = 64 √ 2 (t+ 1)2 (3.3b) one finds f(x, y) = −(2 √ 2 + 32q) ( ∂x ∂q + ∂y ∂q ) + 8q2 ∂x ∂q ∂y ∂q + 128 = 256 [ 1− 2t 2(t2 + 1) (t− 1)2(t+ 1)2 ] (3.17) g(x, y) = 4(n+ 1)q ∂x ∂q − 16n = 16 [ 1 + 2(n+ 1) (t− 1) ] (3.18) h(x, y) = 4(n+ 1)q ∂y ∂q − 16n = 16 [ 1− 2(n+ 1) (t+ 1) ] . (3.7b) This suggests defining w ≡ (t− 1) (t+ 1) (3.8) so that one first has to solve the transcendental equation we (w2−1) 2w = e (x−y) 8 (3.9) to obtain w = w(x− y), from which one gets t = (1 + w) (1− w) = t(x− y). This leads to the following equation for χ ≡ e−imφρnψ: Lm,nχ(q, r) = H(q, r) (2.6) where Lm,n is an hyperbolic operator in the independent variables q and r, and takes the form [6, 8] Lm,n = −(2 √ 2 + 32q) ∂2 ∂q∂r + 4q2 ∂2 ∂q2 + 64 ∂2 ∂r2 + 4(n+ 1)q ∂ ∂q − 16n ∂ ∂r + n2 −m2. (3.26) is a canonical hyperbolic equation of the form ( ∂2 ∂x∂y + A ∂ ∂x +B ∂ ∂y + C ) R(x, y; ξ, η) = 0 (4.1) where A ≡ −a (4.2) B ≡ −b (4.3) 11 C ≡ c− ax − by.

frequency summary: (2.6) is L[χ] = ( ∂2 ∂x∂y + a(x, y) ∂ ∂x + b(x, y) ∂ ∂y + c(x, y) ) χ(x, y) = H˜(x, y) (3.20) where a(x, y) ≡ g(x, y) f(x, y) = 1 16 (1− t)(t+ 1)2(2n+ 1 + t) (t4 + 4t2 − 1) (3.21) b(x, y) ≡ h(x, y) f(x, y) = 1 16 (t+ 1)(t− 1)2(2n+ 1− t) (t4 + 4t2 − 1) (3.22) c(x, y) ≡ n 2 −m2 f(x, y) = (m2 − n2) 256 (t− 1)2(t+ 1)2 (t4 + 4t2 − 1) (3.23) 9 H˜(x, y) ≡ H(x, y) f(x, y) = −H(x, y) 256 (t− 1)2(t+ 1)2 (t4 + 4t2 − 1) . 8 In the (x, y) variables, the operator Lm,n reads therefore Lm,n = f(x, y) ∂ 2 ∂x∂y + g(x, y) ∂ ∂x + h(x, y) ∂ ∂y + n2 −m2 (3.16) where, exploiting the formulae ∂x ∂q = 64 √ 2 (t− 1)2 (3.2b) ∂y ∂q = 64 √ 2 (t+ 1)2 (3.3b) one finds f(x, y) = −(2 √ 2 + 32q) ( ∂x ∂q + ∂y ∂q ) + 8q2 ∂x ∂q ∂y ∂q + 128 = 256 [ 1− 2t 2(t2 + 1) (t− 1)2(t+ 1)2 ] (3.17) g(x, y) = 4(n+ 1)q ∂x ∂q − 16n = 16 [ 1 + 2(n+ 1) (t− 1) ] (3.18) h(x, y) = 4(n+ 1)q ∂y ∂q − 16n = 16 [ 1− 2(n+ 1) (t+ 1) ] . (2.14) This suggests defining yet new variables X ≡ α+R (2.15) Y ≡ α−R (2.16) so that ∂2 ∂α∂R = ∂2 ∂X2 − ∂ 2 ∂Y 2 (2.17) 5 ∂2 ∂α2 + ∂2 ∂R2 = 2 ( ∂2 ∂X2 + ∂2 ∂Y 2 ) (2.18) ∂ ∂α − ∂ ∂R = 2 ∂ ∂Y (2.19) and hence Lm,n reads eventually Tm,n = 16 ∂2 ∂Y 2 + 8n ∂ ∂Y + n2 −m2 − 1√ 2 e−(X+Y )/2 ( ∂2 ∂X2 − ∂ 2 ∂Y 2 ) (2.20) with Green function satisfying the equation Tm,nGm,n ( e X+Y 2 , 2(X − Y ); eX0+Y02 , 2(X0 − Y0) ) = 1 2 δ ( e X+Y 2 − eX0+Y02 ) δ((X − Y )− (X0 − Y0)). For this purpose, recall from [11] that, on denoting by L† the adjoint of the operator L in (3.20), which acts according to L†[χ] = χxy − (aχ)x − (bχ)y + cχ (3.25) one has to find a ‘function’ R(x, y; ξ, η) (actually a kernel) subject to the following condi- tions ((ξ, η) being the coordinates of a point P such that characteristics through it intersect a curve C at points A and B, AP being a segment with constant y, and BP being a segment with constant x): (i) As a function of x and y, R satisfies the adjoint equation L†(x,y)[R] = 0 (3.26) (ii) Rx = bR on AP , i.e. (3.13) One therefore has g′(w) > 0 for all w > 0, and g′(w) < 0 for all w ∈ (−∞, 0)− {−1}, and g is monotonically decreasing for negative w and monotonically increasing for positive w. The point w = −1, at which g′(w) vanishes, is neither a maximum nor a minimum point, because g′′(w) = ( 1 4w3 + 1 2w + 1 + w 4 ) e (w2−1) 2w (3.14) g′′′(w) = ( 1 8w5 − 3 4w4 + 3 8w3 + 3 8w + 3 4 + w 8 ) e (w2−1) 2w . (4.4) Thus, on defining U ≡ R (4.5) V ≡ Rx +BR (4.6) the equation (4.1) for the Riemann function is equivalent to the hyperbolic canonical system [11] Ux = f1(x, y)U + f2(x, y)V (4.7) Vy = g1(x, y)U + g2(x, y)V (4.8) where f1 ≡ −B = b (4.9) f2 = 1 (4.10) g1 ≡ AB − C +By = ab− c+ ax (4.11) g2 ≡ −A = a. 4 Since we are interested in a direct approach to the evaluation of the Green function Gm,n in the (q, r) coordinates, we begin by noticing that, in all derivatives which are not mixed, the operator Lm,n can be made a constant coefficient operator upon setting α ≡ log(q) (2.9) which implies q ∂ ∂q = ∂ ∂α (2.10) q2 ∂2 ∂q2 = ∂2 ∂α2 − ∂ ∂α (2.11) and hence Lm,n = −(2 √ 2e−α + 32) ∂2 ∂α∂r + 4 ∂2 ∂α2 + 64 ∂2 ∂r2 + 4n ∂ ∂α − 16n ∂ ∂r + n2 −m2.

basic summary: Law of total probability and Bayes’ theorem in Riesz spaces In probability theory, the law of total probability and Bayes’ theorem are two fundamental theorems involving conditional probability. Conditional probability in Riesz spaces To extend the notion of conditional probability in probability theory to Riesz spaces, we first recall the following definition. A band B in a Riesz space is said to be a projection band if X equals the direct sum of B and Bd, that is, X = B⊕Bd.

In this note, we follow [22] to extend the concept of conditional probability to Riesz spaces and then establish the law of total probability and Bayes’ theorem in Riesz spaces; we also prove an inclusion-exclusion formula in Riesz spaces. Definition 4.1 in [22] 5defines two projection bands PB1 and PB2 to be independent with respect to a conditional expectation T in a Dedekind complete Riesz space if TPB1TPB2(e) = TPB1PB2(e) = TPB2TPB1(e).

text_rank summary: It is evident that if PB1 = PB2 then PB1|B2 = I, where I is the identity operator on E. Since two band projections on a Riesz space are commutative, Equation (3.1) may be replaced by P (B1 | B2)(f) = [TPB1PB2(f)] [TPB2(f)] −1, ∀f ∈ E, provided TPB2(f) 6= 0.Let E be a Dedekind complete lattice-ordered field with a con- ditional expectation T and a weak unit e such that T (e) = e. Suppose B1 and B2 are two projection bands, PB1 and PB2 are the corresponding band projections of 4 HONG B1 and B2, respectively, and B1 ∩B2 6= φ.A band B in a Riesz space is said to be a projection band if X equals the direct sum of B and Bd, that is, X = B⊕Bd.

Title: On minimum sum representations for weighted voting games
Word count: 3183
Abstract: A proposal in a weighted voting game is accepted if the sum of the(non-negative) weights of the "yea" voters is at least as large as a givenquota. Several authors have considered representations of weighted voting gameswith minimum sum, where the weights and the quota are restricted to beintegers. Freixas and Molinero have classified all weighted voting gameswithout a unique minimum sum representation for up to 8 voters. Here weexhaustively classify all weighted voting games consisting of 9 voters which donot admit a unique minimum sum integer weight representation.Comment: 7 pages, 6 tables; enumerations correcte

Title: Surgery for Triple Pathology of Giant Vestibular Schwannoma Associated with Carotid Artery Stenosis and Intracranial Aneurysm: Case Report
Word count: 2377
Abstract: Here we report the case of a 56-year-old woman who presented with a highly unusual combination of three pathologies, namely a giant left-sided vestibular schwannoma, severe stenosis of the left internal carotid artery, and a right anterior cerebral artery aneurysm. The chosen approach comprised three consecutive surgical procedures, namely (1) aneurysm embolization, (2) carotid stenosis stenting, and (3) vestibular schwannoma excision. This approach avoided complications and achieved a satisfactory functional outcome. To the best of our knowledge, this combination of three conditions has not been previously reported in the English-language literature

Introduction This report describes a highly unusual case of a woman who presented with three pathologies, namely a giant left-sided vestibular schwannoma (VS), severe stenosis of the left internal carotid artery (ICA), and a right anterior cerebral artery (ACA) aneurysm. If stenosis elimination is the ﬁrst step, then this may increase the risk of aneurysm rupture due to the higher arterial blood ﬂow to cerebral vessels.6,7 As the circle of Willis remains intact, the restora- tion of the left ICA opening may increase the perfusion pressure in both the right carotid basin and adjacent cerebral arterial basins, which, in turn, can increase the risk of aneurysm rupture. Surgery Stage I: Endovascular Embolization of the Right ACA Aneurysm Using a transfemoral right-sided approach, a Guider Softip XF 6.0-F guiding catheter (Stryker Neurovascular, Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States) was inserted into the patient’s right ICA, and an Excelsior-10 microcatheter (Stryker Neurovascu- lar) onaTransend-10microconductor (StrykerNeurovascular) was inserted into the aneurysm cavity.

Title: LEAD IN THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE CITY OF DNIPRO AND ITS BIOMONITORING IN THE BODY OF THE PRESCHOOL CHILDREN
Word count: 2045
Abstract: Among a variety of chemical environmental factors that adversely affect the health of the population, especially dangerous are the heavy metals. The most widespread among them is lead. Numerous researches by scientists indicate the negative impact of this metal on health and, above all, on the health of the children's population. The purpose of the work is a comprehensive hygienic assessment of the content of the lead in environmental objects of an environmentally dangerous area and its impact on the health of children of preschool age. The studies on the content of lead in the air, drinking water, local food products in 2 industrial districts of the city of Dnipro and conditionally clean area have been conducted. Its total daily income in the body of preschool children who live in these areas has been calculated. Its content in the biosubstrates of these children (blood, hair, teeth and urine) has been determined. The obtained data made it expedient and necessary to develop and implement a set of measures, the aim of which is to reduce the external "stress" of this abiotic metal and to increase the resistance and adaptability of the child's body

basic summary: Multiple correlation analysis indicates that the lead content in the blood and hair is most closely related to the concentration of the lead in the food. A reliable correlation between the lead content in the environmental objects and its concentration in the children's biosubstrates has been established. At the same time, the lead content in the children's hair is 1.6 times higher than in the adults’, which may be due to its more active absorption. Antonova O. V. Monitoring of the changes of the premorbid indicators of the children's health under the influence of low lead concentrations // Укр. A pair correlation analysis found that the content of the lead in the blood is directly proportional to the activity of the δ-ALA and accumulation in the hair. The level of the lead in the blood is the main indicator of its influence on the health of children. In regional food products, the lead was continuously determined in the concentrations of 0.01 0.1 mg / kg, which is not higher than MLC. In the tap water, lead was recorded in concentrations that do not exceed the corresponding MLC by the average annual values.

text_rank summary: The conducted study of the lead content in  the ground layer of the atmospheric air in the residential area of the second industrial region showed  that the metal under the study was determined continuously with a difference in the absolute values  from 0.01 to 0.34 μg / m3.So, despite the relatively low external  concentrations of the lead in the environmental objects, with its integrated intake into the body of  children, the internal content exceeds the permissible ones, which is confirmed by the increased  concentrations in the biosubstrates, which can be associated with a long and constant intake of it into  the body of a child with the air, water and food.At the same time, the lead content in the air of the industrial areas is 0.03-0.04 μg /  m3, which is 14 times higher than the control one (p <0.001).The concentrations of the lead in the urine of the surveyed  children (Table 2) in both of the industrial and control areas are above the norm by 6.4-11.2-12.8 times  and can be regarded as a metal bearing or the initial stages of the intoxication [8], which finds a place in  33-66 % of the preschoolers from the industrial regions, as well as in 12 % of children from the control  area.The  increased content of the lead in the biosubstrates was accompanied by an increased activity of δ-ALA by  1,2 and 1,9 times higher than the norm, which was observed in 51-89 % of the examined patients, with  the normal values in the children of the control region [4, 11].The hair of the  preschoolers from the industrial regions (Table 3) contains lead in the concentrations corresponding to  the permissible level in the first one, but exceeds it by 1.3 times in the second one.At  the same time, the lead content in the children's hair is 1.6 times higher than in the adults’, which may  be due to its more active absorption.Antonova O.

The concentrations of the lead in the urine of the surveyed  children (Table 2) in both of the industrial and control areas are above the norm by 6.4-11.2-12.8 times  and can be regarded as a metal bearing or the initial stages of the intoxication [8], which finds a place in  33-66 % of the preschoolers from the industrial regions, as well as in 12 % of children from the control  area. So, despite the relatively low external  concentrations of the lead in the environmental objects, with its integrated intake into the body of  children, the internal content exceeds the permissible ones, which is confirmed by the increased  concentrations in the biosubstrates, which can be associated with a long and constant intake of it into  the body of a child with the air, water and food. It should be  emphasized that in 73-78 % of children from the industrial areas, the lead content is higher than the  quoted norm and 2-3.5 times higher than in the children from the control area. Thus, a strong direct relationship was established between the content of the lead in the  air, products, its TDI and concentration in the blood (r = 0.85, p <0.001, r = 0.92, p <0.001, r = 0.78, p  <0.001). The lead  content in the drinking water of the observation areas is 0.004-0.008 mg / l, in the tap water of the  control area is 0.003 mg / l. In some periods in the drinking water of the industrial regions the  concentration of the lead was at the level of MLC.

Title: Condition of periapical tissues in endodonically treated teeth
Word count: 2710
Abstract: The aim of the study was to evaluate the possible relationship between the quality of restoration of the tooth crown, root canal obturation and periapical status of endodontic teeth. A series of X-ray images from randomly selected patient cards was studied at the Dental Faculty of the Dnepropetrovsk Medical Academy. A total of 1001 endodontically treated teeth restored by permanent restoration were evaluated independently by two experts. According to a predetermined set of radiographic criteria, the technical quality of filling the root canals of the tooth was assessed as good (GE) or poor (PE). In turn, the technical quality of restoration of the tooth crown was also evaluated as good (GR), or poor (PR). Then, the roots of the teeth and the surrounding tissues were evaluated, and according to the available treatment result were classified as successful or unsuccessful. The success rate for all endodontic teeth was 66.4 % (n ‰ 1001). Teeth with root pins had a success rate of 72.7 % (n ‰ 527), the success rate of dental treatment without pins was 64.6% (n ‰ 472). The two groups with technically good endodontics had the highest success rates. In combination with technically good restorations, the success rate was 82% (GE + GR, 82 %), in the case of technically weak restorations, the success rate was 72 % (GE + PR, 72 %). Two groups with technically bad endodontics combined with good restorations or poor restorations had significantly lower success rates (PE + GR, 55 % and PE = PR, 57 %). When assessing the periapical status of endodontic teeth, it was found that the quality of endodontic treatment, evaluated radiographically, is much more important than the quality of restoration of the crown of the tooth

basic summary: *The difference between the success rate with Good Endodontics and Poor Endodontics was statistically significant (P<0.0001) re- gardless of the quality of the coronal restoration (GR or PR). Teeth with root pins had a success rate of 72.7 % (n ‰ 527), the success rate of dental treatment without pins was 64.6% (n ‰ 472). Teeth with root ca- nal posts (n=528 had a success rate of 72 % and teeth without posts (n=473) had a success rate of 64 %. However, if the quality of the root filling was poor, the quality of the coronal restoration was of no importance for the outcome of the endodontic treatment. *The difference between the success rate with Good Endodontics and Poor Endodontics was statistically significant (P_0.0001) re- gardless of the quality of the coronal restoration (GR or PR). The differ- ence between the success rate with Good Endodontics and Poor Endodontics was statistically significant regardless of the quality of the coronal restoration. The dif- ference between the success rate with Good Endodontics and Poor Endodontics was statistically significant regardless of the quality of the coronal restoration. If the quality of the root filling was good, a good restoration improved on the endodontic suc- cess rate. In the teeth diag- nosed with Poor Endodontics the success rate dropped and was the same regardless of the quality of the coronal restoration (PE+GR, 55% and PE+PR, 57%). **The difference between the success rate of teeth with Good and Poor Restoration was stastistically significant (P<0.001). The lowest success rate (48 %) was found in the combination Poor Endodontics and Poor Restora- tions (PE=PR) in teeth without posts (Table 5). Ray H.A., Trope M.

Title: Solving the dark matter problem through dynamic interactions
Word count: 2851
Abstract: Owing to the renewed interest in dark matter after the upgrade of the largehadron collider and its dedication to dark matter research it is timely toreassess the whole problem. Considering dark matter is one way to reconcile thediscrepancy between the velocity of matter in the outer regions of galaxies andthe observed galactic mass. So far, no credible candidate for dark matter hasbeen identified. Here, we develop a model accounting for observations byrotations and interactions between rotating objects analogous to magneticfields and interactions with moving charges. The magnitude of these fields isdescribed by a fundamental constant of the order 10-41kg-1. The sameinteractions can be observed in the solar system where they lead to smallchanges in planetary orbits.Comment: 4 pages and 3 figure
basic similarity: 0.5974293978908765
basic summary: Hence, FR = R(r)×V(r) = −µR MV 20 r er (4) for a suitably chosen value of the rotor constant µR. The field R for positive rotation can then be described by: R (r) = µR ez r ∫ dr′ρ(r′)2pir′V (r′). If rotor fields and their interactions are real, then they must apply to all rotating masses, as well as to the mass within the solar system. Considering dark matter is one way to reconcile the discrepancy between the velocity of matter in the outer regions of galaxies and the observed galactic mass. The assumption that the perihelion advance of Mercury, as shown in Figure 3, is due to rotor fields would allow us to calibrate the rotor field constant. The rotor constant µR can be calculated from existing data with the relationship between velocities V , galactic mass M , and acceleration constant a0.

sim_matrix summary: Moreover, as shown by the estimate of the effect of solar rotation, rotor fields arise from the orbital velocity of mass around the galactic center and the rotation of mass in individual stellar objects. If rotor fields and their interactions are real, then they must apply to all rotating masses, as well as to the mass within the solar system. (2) Here, µR is the rotor constant, which will be determined from astronomical data, ez is a unit vector in the z-direction, ρ(r′) is the two-dimensional mass density, and V (r′) is the angular velocity of the mass distribution. The question of whether the advance of mercury’s orbit is caused by the rotation of solar mass or the distortion of the flat space–time geometry due to solar mass will have to be addressed in the future. The concept of rotor fields and forces is similar to the modified Newtonian dynamics in that it provides a solution to the problem with a change in interactions of moving mass, rather than with additional mass components. In summary, we have shown that a new mode of interactions of mass in motion leads to the prediction of flat velocity distributions in galaxies and a dependency of this velocity on galactic mass.

text_rank summary: As the mass density of a galaxy is usually concentrated near the center and decreases with the square of the distance from the center[4], we may further simplify the equation by assuming that most of the galactic mass M is contained within a certain radius r0, and that the velocity distribution of this mass can be replaced by a constant V0.However, it is likely that a0 will vary for different galaxies, and astronomical data show that the velocity does not exactly follow a fourth-power law[10]; i.e., this derivation of the Tully–Fisher relation is only an approximation.There has to be some radius r′ = r0/x, where the rotor fields of matter rotating inside will determine the dynamics of mass rotating outside, while inside this radius, dynamics will be determined mainly by gravitational attraction.The concept of dark matter, as Milgrom pointed out[7], is based on three separate assumptions: (i) the force governing the dynamics of interstellar hydrogen is gravity, (ii) the gravitational force depends on the source of the gravity field and the mass of the particle, and (iii) Newtons second law.Because the effect of rotor fields will lead to flat velocity distributions with increasing distance from the center of the solar system, as explained above, we expect similar deviations from current theories on gravitation as well for the outer regions of the system.The following model of stellar dynamics is based on two discrete assumptions: (i) mass in angular rotation around the galactic center generates a rotor field, which is radiated outward in the plane of the galaxy, and (ii) the field amplitude linearly decreases with increasing distance from the center.

tfidf summary: For a velocity vector in the ϕ-direction, owing to the circular rotation around the galactic center, V(r) = r · ω(r)eϕ, and the resulting rotor force FR on a unit mass will be directed inward along the radial vector er and will be equal to the centrifugal forces directed outward, if ω(r) = V0/r. [2] Vera C. Rubin and W. Kent Ford Jr., Astrophys. The reason for such an assumption can be found in electrodynamics[9], where charges interact through two separate fields: they interact either through electrostatic Coulomb fields, equivalent to gravitational interactions of mass, or through magnetic fields, which currently have no equivalent in the theory of mass dynamics. This simplifies Eq. The second assumption is the application of Gausss law to a two-dimensional system[9]. The concept of rotor fields and forces is similar to the modified Newtonian dynamics in that it provides a solution to the problem with a change in interactions of moving mass, rather than with additional mass components.

frequency summary: For a velocity vector in the ϕ-direction, owing to the circular rotation around the galactic center, V(r) = r · ω(r)eϕ, and the resulting rotor force FR on a unit mass will be directed inward along the radial vector er and will be equal to the centrifugal forces directed outward, if ω(r) = V0/r. The result is the same as with the modified Newtonian dynamics: while gravity as described by Newtons or Einsteins theory of gravitation will lead to a decreasing angular velocity as the distance from the center increases, this model of rotor fields and dynamic interactions yields a flat velocity distribution. It has indeed been observed that the nodes of Venus move by approximately 10 arc seconds per century 6[15], an observation which cannot be explained by general relativity and is indeed accounted for – within the errors likely to arise from the simplification of this model – in the model of rotor fields and rotor forces. For ωS = 4.45 × 10−7s−1 and a solar radius rS = 6.96× 108m, the rotor field in the plane perpendicular to the solar axis of rotation will be R(r) = µR ez r 3.63× 1032kgs−1. The following model of stellar dynamics is based on two discrete assumptions: (i) mass in angular rotation around the galactic center generates a rotor field, which is radiated outward in the plane of the galaxy, and (ii) the field amplitude linearly decreases with increasing distance from the center. Moreover, as shown by the estimate of the effect of solar rotation, rotor fields arise from the orbital velocity of mass around the galactic center and the rotation of mass in individual stellar objects.

If H has an additional meromorphic first integral on some fixed energy level H = E, then the Galois group over K˜ of equation (2) is virtually abelian for the corresponding value of E. 8 Proof. This corresponds to functions in p2, q2, meromorphic on a neighbourhood of the curve R(p2, q2) = E outside the singular points, re- stricted to the curve R(p2, q2) = E. Using the same parametrization as in Theorem 5, we express p2 in function of q2 = t and this gives p2 = √ i √ 2(t3 + 1) arccos ( 2 √ 2t−3/2 ) t3 √ 8− t3 + E t3 + 1 t4 After simplification, we see that the corresponding field is an algebraic ex- tension of degree 2 of K˜, and so the identity component of the Galois group of equation (2) will not change if we take K˜ instead of the field as base field.

On a fixed energy hypersurface 3 H = E, the Hamiltonian system restricted to this hypersurface does not pos- sess a non constant first integral in K. The plan of the proof is the following • First we study smoothness of possible first integrals in K, in particular singular points of elliptic functions involved.This corresponds to functions in p2, q2, meromorphic on a neighbourhood of the curve R(p2, q2) = E outside the singular points, re- stricted to the curve R(p2, q2) = E.

Title: A New Model for Strange Stars
Word count: 3384
Abstract: In the present work, we attempt to find a new class of solutions for thespherically symmetric perfect fluid sphere by employing the HomotopyPerturbation Method (HPM), a new tool via which the mass polynomial functionfacilitates to tackle the Einstein field equations. A set of interior solutionsfound on the basis of the simplest MIT bag model equation of state (EOS) in theform $p=\frac{1}{3}(\rho-4B)$ where $B$ is the bag constant. The proposedinterior metric for the stellar system is consistent with the exteriorSchwarzschild spacetime on the boundary. In addition, we also conduct adetailed study on different tests, viz. the energy conditions, TOV equation,adiabatic index, Buchdahl limit, etc., to verify the physical validity of theproposed model. The numerical value of the used parameters is predicted fordifferent strange star candidates, for different chosen values of the bagconstant. In a nutshell, by exploiting HPM technique first time ever in thefield of relativistic astrophysics, we have predicted in the present literaturea singularity-free and stable stellar model which is suitable to describeultra-dense objects, like strange (quark) stars.Comment: 19 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables, major revisio

Title: Interaction and Identification of the Doubly Heavy Di-Hadronic Molecules
Word count: 2776
Abstract: We study the interesting problem of interaction and identification of thehadronic molecules which seem to be deuteron-like structure. In particular, wepropose a binding mechanism in which One Boson Exchange Potential plus Yukawascreen-like potential is applied in their relative s-wave state. We propose thedipole-like interaction between two color neutral states to form a hadronicmolecule. For the identification of the hadronic molecules, the Weinberg'scompositeness theorem is used to distinguish the molecule from confined(elementary) state. The present formalism predict some di-hadronic molecularstates, involving quarks (s, c, b or $\overline{s}$, $\overline{c}$,$\overline{b}$) as a constituents, namely, $pn$, $K\overline{K}$, $\rho\overline{\rho}$, $K^{*}\overline{K^{*}}$,$D\overline{D^{*}}$($\overline{D}D^{*}$), $D^{*}\overline{D^{*}}$,$B\overline{B^{*}}$, $B^{*}\overline{B^{*}}$,  $D^{*\pm}\overline{D_{1}^{0}}$, $ D^{0}\overline{K^{\pm}}$,$D^{*0}\overline{K^{\pm}}$, with their possible quantum numbers.Comment: 10 page

This state is just below the DD∗ threshold and its very small binding energy and narrow width made this state spacial.

With the expected value of binding energy for the deuteron, the scattering length and effec- tive range are in agreement with experimental values (as=5.41 fm, re=1.75 fm) for Z=0.1 whereas effective range gains negative value from Z=0.4 and tend to larger as Z → 1 which indicates that the state is composite.

Title: Two-way communication with a single quantum particle
Word count: 2999
Abstract: In this letter we show that communication when restricted to a singleinformation carrier (i.e. single particle) and finite speed of propagation isfundamentally limited for classical systems. On the other hand, quantum systemscan surpass this limitation. We show that communication bounded to the exchangeof a single quantum particle (in superposition of different spatial locations)can result in "two-way signaling" which is impossible in classical physics. Wequantify the discrepancy between classical and quantum scenarios by theprobability of winning a game played by distant players. We generalize ourresult to an arbitrary number of parties and we show that the probability ofsuccess is asymptotically decreasing to zero as the number of parties grows,for all classical strategies. In contrast, quantum strategy allows players towin the game with certainty.Comment: Published version. The follow-up paper, including experimental test  and secure communication with hidden direction, is given here:  arXiv:1802.0510

For example, if Alice holds the particle, she can imprint the message in it and send it to Bob.Let A and B share a single quantum particle prepared in a superposition of their two distinct locations, i.e.Therefore, the probability distribution p(ab|xy) is a classical mixture of one-way signaling dis- tributions, i.e.The simple calculation shows that the final state (after transformation) is given by |ψ〉f = ωmaˆ†n|0〉0 .At time t = 0, A and B are given the input variables x and y by the referee and they are asked to reveal the output variables a and b at the later time t = τ .Since they are missing the information on m, they can only guess the value of n (in order to validate n = k).In the next step, each of them sends his/her “part” of particle towards the polygon center, where the particle hits the unitary device that coherently “splits” the particle into N different di- rection aˆ†k −→ N−1∑ l=0 Uklaˆ † l .The critical value for probability of success (classical bound) is 1/N , therefore we get the upper noise threshold of λc = 1− 1 N 1−pnoise ≥ 1− 1N which is a remarkable resistance of |ψ〉in to arbitrary noise.

The referee asks each player, say Ak, to answer the following question: Qk : Does the given input string X satisfies n = k? Some of these novel phenomena have been demonstrated in recent experiments [13, 14]. Here as a carrier, we think of a particle or object that can travel with the finite speed bounded by c. For simplicity, we assume that the speed of information transfer matches the maximal value c. For example, if Alice holds the particle, she can imprint the message in it and send it to Bob.

frequency summary: For the case of bi- nary inputs x, y = 0, 1 and binary outputs a, b = 0, 1, there are only two inequivalent inequalities [16] p(a = y, b = x) ≤ 1 2 , (2) p(x(a⊕ y) = y(b⊕ x) = 0) ≤ 3 4 , (3) known as two variants of “guess your neighbor’s input” (GYNI) game [17]. (7) Finally, after exchanging the communication (at time τ), the final state reads |ψ〉f =   |1〉A|0〉B, x = 0, y = 0; |0〉A|1〉B, x = 0, y = 1; −|0〉A|1〉B, x = 1, y = 0; −|1〉A|0〉B, x = 1, y = 1. In the classical case, it is clear that within the time window τ only a single “one-way” communication be- tween two players can occur (during τ the particle can cover distance d, thus it can travel from one vertex to the polygon center and from there to an arbitrary ver- tex). either x influences a and b, whereas y influences b only (left) or y influences a and b, whereas x influences a only (right). either x influences a and b, whereas y influences b only or y influences a and b, whereas x influences a only. Now, since Al has in possession xk = nk + m and xl = nl +m, he can simply find the difference xk − xl = n(k − l) and from there he can ex- tract the value of n = (xk − xl)(k − l)−1 (N is chosen to be a prime number, thus the division modulo N is well defined). In addition, a unitary device is placed right in the middle between A and B (at the distance d/2, see Figure 2), such that the particle, when sent from A to B, is “half-reflected” and “half-transmitted” in a coherent way. In order to win the game, only one player has to answer with “YES” (n = k is true for one k only), while the rest shall answer with “NO”.

Title: Three-dimensional anomalous twisted gauge theories with global symmetry:  Implications for quantum spin liquids
Word count: 2520
Abstract: Topological spin liquids can be described by topological gauge theories withglobal symmetry. Due to the presence of both nontrivial bulk deconfined gaugefluxes and global symmetry, topological spin liquids are examples of theso-called "Symmetry Enriched Topological phases" (SET). In this paper, we findthat, in some twisted versions of topological gauge theories (with discreteAbelian gauge group $G_g$), implementing a global symmetry (denoted by $G_s$)is anomalous although symmetry charge carried by topological point-likeexcitations is normally fractionalized and classified by the second cohomologygroup. To demonstrate the anomaly, we fully gauge the global symmetry,rendering a new gauge theory that is not gauge invariant. Therefore, the SETorder of the ground state is anomalous, which cannot exist in 3D system alone.Such anomalous state construction generalizes the "2D surface topologicalorder" to 3D. A concrete example with $G_g=\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_4$ and$G_s=\mathbb{Z}_2$ is calculated.Comment: 4 page

basic summary: (5,6), the coefficient q should be quantized as: either q = 8 mod 16 or q = 0 mod 16 such that the new gauge theory is gauge invariant. The coupling term (11) means that all Z4 gauge charge excitations carry Z2 symmetry charge while Z2 gauge charge excitations are not charged under Z2 sym- metry. • The anomalous gauge theory described by the ac- tion (24) may appear as a boundary state of a (4+1)D gauge theory (topological order state). In order to show the anomaly, we fully gauge the global symmetry and obtain a new gauge theory. However, the initial value of q before gauging is q = 4 mod 8, which explicitly leads to violation of gauge invariance in the new gauge the- ory. Therefore, the resulting new gauge theory is a Z2 × Z8 gauge theory with a twisted term.
sim_matrix similarity: 0.46569404599009473
sim_matrix summary: GAUGE ANOMALY We start with the following action of a twisted gauge theory with gauge group Gg = Z2 × Z4: S = ˆ i 2 2π b1 ∧ da1 + ˆ i 4 2π b2 ∧ da2 + ˆ i q 4π2 a1 ∧ a2 ∧ da2 , (3) where the first and second terms are the usual BF terms that determine the gauge group Gg. • The new gauge theory described by the action (24) has gauge anomaly. In the subset, all topological orders are described by twisted gauge theories [20] of a discrete gauge group Gg = ZN1 ×ZN2×· · · . Therefore, the new gauge theory indeed has gauge anomaly. Therefore, the resulting new gauge theory is a Z2 × Z8 gauge theory with a twisted term. Otherwise, symmetry implementation is anomalous and the resulting new gauge theory admits gauge anomaly.

text_rank summary: To assign symmetry, e.g., Gs = Z2, we add the follow- ing coupling term as an example: Scoupling = ˆ i 1 2π b2 ∧ dA (11) where A is the external (background) gauge field that is subject to the following constraint: ˆ L A = 0,±π,±2π, · · · , (12) for any spacetime loops L. In Scoupling , A minimally couples to the topological current: J = 1 2π ⋆ db2 (13) Physically, this 1-form current represents the particle current in the Z4 gauge theory [see the second term in Eq.In the present case, we may denote the twisted gauge theory (24) by (Z2×Z8)q where q takes value 4 mod 8 that is half of the normal one 8 mod 16.To be much clearer, we may introduce quasipar- ticle current j of the Z4 gauge group, which minimally couples to a2: Sexcitation = ˆ ij ∧ ⋆a2 + ˆ iΣ ∧ ⋆b2 + · · · , (14) where Σ is 2-form current variable for loop excitations in the Z4 gauge theory.GAUGE ANOMALY We start with the following action of a twisted gauge theory with gauge group Gg = Z2 × Z4: S = ˆ i 2 2π b1 ∧ da1 + ˆ i 4 2π b2 ∧ da2 + ˆ i q 4π2 a1 ∧ a2 ∧ da2 , (3) where the first and second terms are the usual BF terms that determine the gauge group Gg.Since now all gauge fields in the action are fully dynamical, one can apply general linear transformations GL(3,Z) × GL(3,Z) on two-form and one-form gauge fields independently in order to send the above theory to its canonical form: W =   1 −1 0 −1 2 0 0 0 1   , (18) Ω =   1 0 0 4 1 0 0 0 1   , (19) W   2 0 0 1 4 0 0 0 2  ΩT =   1 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 2   .If the resulting new gauge theory is well-defined (e.g., at least gauge invariant), the symmetry implementation is anomaly-free.

Mathemat- ically, the symmetry-fractionalization is classified by the 3second cohomology group: H2(Z2,Z4) = Z2, which im- plies that there are two sets of topologically distinct pat- terns of symmetry fractionalization on Z4 gauge charge excitations: · · · ∼ − 1 4 ∼ 1 4 ∼ 3 4 ∼ · · · · · · ∼ −1 ∼ − 1 2 ∼0 ∼ 1 2 ∼ 1 ∼ · · · Therefore, in the present case, half-charge is indistin- guishable from integer charge. The action can be rewritten as the following form: S = ˆ i 1 2π ( B b2 b1 )   2 0 0 1 4 0 0 0 2     A a2 a1   + ˆ i q 4π2 a1 ∧ a2 ∧ da2 (17) with q = 4 mod 8. The action is given by: S = ˆ i 2 2π b1 ∧ da1 + ˆ i 4 2π b2 ∧ da2 + ˆ i q 4π2 a1 ∧ a2 ∧ da2 + ˆ i 1 2π b2 ∧ dA + ˆ i 2 2π B ∧ dA , (16) where gauge field A is now considered as a dynamical gauge field rather than background gauge field. (17) is transformed to: Stwist = ˆ i q 4π2 A2 ∧ A1 ∧ dA1 (23) Together with the BF term in the canonical form, we obtain the total action in the new basis: S = ˆ i 8 2π B2 ∧ dA2 + ˆ i 2 2π B1 ∧ dA1 + ˆ i q 4π2 A2 ∧ A1 ∧ dA1 (24) where we have omitted the trivial term: i ´ 1 2pi B3 ∧ dA3.

Title: Assessment of the diagnostic score scales in acute appendicitis
Word count: 919
Abstract: Thus, the score in the range of 5 to 10 is a reliable mark of inflammatory changes in the appendix. At the same time, a direct correlation was found between the depth of inflammatory changes in the appendix walls and the sum of the scores. Thus, in the destructive forms of acute apendicitis, the sum of scores had higher indications than the catarrhal form. Given the erased clinical course of acute appendicitis during pregnancy in most cases, the scale can only be used in conjunction with other diagnostic methods

basic summary: Thus, the leukogram indexes have a high informative value in assess- ing the severity of the inflammatory process and destructive changes in acute ap- pendicitis in pregnant women. During laparoscopy, 6 (7.5%) women of the first group showed no signs of inflammation of the appendix, and the diagnosis of acute appendicitis was excluded. Clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis has traditionally come first among other diagnostic methods, but the informative value of many ap- pendicular symptoms during pregnancy is low. Meanwhile, the possibility of a clinical blood test for acute appendicitis in pregnant women is not enough to reveal.

sim_matrix summary: Low leukocytosis does not disprove the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, and the  presence of only an increased number of common leukocytes, without taking into  account the shift of the leukocyte formula, does not allow to consider them a diag- nostic criterion for acute appendicitis in pregnant women. There are reports that the level of leukocytes has  no practical significance in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis and the more so does  not allow to assume its form. During laparoscopy, 6 (7.5%) women of the first  group showed no signs of inflammation of the appendix, and the diagnosis of acute  appendicitis was excluded. The Alvarado scale showed  high value  of sensitivity and accuracy in a group of pregnant women.

frequency summary: When com- paring the catarrhal and destructive forms of the disease, there was a significant in- crease in these parameters (p <0.05), which indicated the presence and depth of  the inflammatory process in the appendix and allowed to clearly distinguish the se- rous stage of the inflammatory process from the pronounced destructive one. Thus, the leukogram indexes have a high informative value in assess- ing the severity of the inflammatory process and destructive changes in acute ap- pendicitis in pregnant women. Low leukocytosis does not disprove the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, and the  presence of only an increased number of common leukocytes, without taking into  account the shift of the leukocyte formula, does not allow to consider them a diag- nostic criterion for acute appendicitis in pregnant women. But taking into account the fact that in pregnant women, leu- kocytosis is a physiological phenomenon, therefore, it is not possible to consider the  nature of the inflammatory process, the destruction in the appendix and talk about  the morphological form of appendicitis with such changes in leukocytosis.

Title: Memory-Usage Advantageous Block Recursive Matrix Inverse
Word count: 2886
Abstract: The inversion of extremely high order matrices has been a challenging taskbecause of the limited processing and memory capacity of conventionalcomputers. In a scenario in which the data does not fit in memory, it is worthto consider exchanging less memory usage for more processing time in order toenable the computation of the inverse which otherwise would be prohibitive. Wepropose a new algorithm to compute the inverse of block partitioned matriceswith a reduced memory footprint. The algorithm works recursively to invert oneblock of a $k \times k$ block matrix $M$, with $k \geq 2$, based on thesuccessive splitting of $M$. It computes one block of the inverse at a time, inorder to limit memory usage during the entire processing. Experimental resultsshow that, despite increasing computational complexity, matrices that otherwisewould exceed the memory-usage limit can be inverted using this technique

basic summary: With this notation, block Mαβ has dimension b× b, with b = m k , and M = (Mαβ) is a k − by − k block matrix. The proposed algorithm works recursively to invert one block of a k× k block matrix A, with k ≥ 2, based on the successive splitting of A. In , the authors give inverse formulae for 2×2 block matrices applied in block triangular matrices and various structured matrices such as Hamiltonian, per-Hermitian 2 and centro-Hermitian matrices. In , a recursive algorithm is applied for the determination of the first block row of the inverse of a block circulant matrix with circulant blocks. The forward recursive procedure terminates after k − 2 steps, when the resulting frames have 2 × 2 blocks. 〈〈M〉〉 =  〈〈M〉A〉 〈〈M〉B〉 〈〈M〉C〉 〈〈M〉D〉  (36) Thus, 〈〈M〉〉 is a 2 × 2 block matrix generated from the original 4 × 4 block matrix .

Title: Baryon Production at p-p Collider Experiments: Average Transverse  Momenta vs. Energy and Mass
Word count: 3255
Abstract: This paper examines the transverse momentum spectra of baryons in the multiparticle production at modern colliders using Quark-Gluon String Model (QGSM).It discusses 1) the difference in \Lambda^0 hyperon spectra atantiproton-proton vs. proton-proton reactions; 2) the growth of averagetransverse momenta of \Lambda hyperon with proton-proton collision energies and3) the dependence of average p_t on the masses of mesons and baryons at the LHCenergy 7 TeV. This analysis of baryon spectra led to the following conclusions.First, the fragmentation of antidiquark-diquark side of pomeron diagram makesthe major contribution to baryon production spectra in the asymmetricantiproton-proton reaction. Second, the average p_t's of hyperons steadily growwith energy on the range from 53 GeV to 7 TeV. Since no dramatic changes wereseen in the characteristics of baryon production, the hadroproduction processesdo not cause the "knee" in the cosmic ray proton spectra at the energiesbetween Tevatron and LHC. Third, the average transverse momentum analysisthrough examining the different masses of baryons and hadrons reveals theregularity in the mass gaps between hadron generations. This observation givesthe possibility for more hadrons with the masses: 0.253, 0.688, 1.87, 5.09,13.7, 37.3, 101, 276, 749... GeV, which are produced by geometrical progressionwith the mass factor of order 2.71828. Such hadrons with the masses beyond therange of known heavy baryons may be multiquark states like tetraquarks,pentaquarks and so forth.Comment: 11 pages, 11 .eps figures, ICHEP16 poste

basic summary: The analysis of average baryon transverse momenta in the framework of QGSM clearly demonstrates that the average transverse momentum of baryons grows steadily with energy (see figure 9). The pomeron diagrams of p − p and p¯ − p collisions are shown in the figure 6. The transverse momentum baryon spectra in antiproton-proton collisions (UA1, UA5, CDF) differ from the pt distributions of baryons in proton-proton collisions (ISR, STAR, LHC). The resulting spectra consist of the contribution from only diquark-antidiquark chain that allows us to see the pure form of baryon transverse momentum distributions in asymmetric case of fragmentation. 3 Baryon Transverse Momentum Distributions in QGSM The QGS Model has been devised for the description of rapidity distributions and hadron spectra in xF 10. 4.1 The Data of UA5 Experiment This subsection discusses the influence of quark composition of beam particles on the shape of transverse momentum spectra of Λ0 hyperon production. The heavy quark meson spectra were fitted with the same formula (1) as the baryon spectra (see the figure 10).

The analysis of average baryon transverse momenta in the framework of QGSM clearly demonstrates that the average transverse momentum of baryons grows steadily with energy (see figure 9). It discusses 1) the difference in Λ0 hyperon spectra at proton-antiproton vs. proton- proton reactions; 2) the growth of average transverse momenta of Λ hyperon with proton-proton collision energies and 3) the dependence of average pt on the masses of mesons and baryons at the LHC energy 7 TeV.

text_rank summary: The comparison of diagrams shows that the most important contribution to hadron production spectra in p¯− p reaction is brought by the fragmentation of antidiquark-diquark chain of pomeron cylinder, because this side of diagram takes the greater part of energy of colliding particles.4.2 The Difference in Distributions from antiproton-proton and proton-proton re- actions in QGSM The difference in pt-spectra of Λ 0’s produced in high energy p − p and p¯ − p colli- sions cannot be explained in the perturbative QCD models, since both interactions should give the mutiparticle production in central rapidity region due to dominat- ing one Pomeron exchange.We can conclude that transverse momentum spectra are harder with the energy growth that provides the change in the slopes, beginning from B=4,2 for ISR data, B=2,6 for STAR and to B=2,0 at 900 GeV in ALICE.The form of baryon spectra in antiproton-proton reaction of low energy was planned to be studied in experiment TAPAS 14. p p _ Λ K Λ ss _ Λ _ ss _ Figure 7: The low energy diagram with quark-antiquark annihilation and diquark-antidiquark chain fragmentation.The sharp exponential contribution to spectra is seen in p¯− p reaction at √s = 546 GeV in UA5 collaboration data4 at very low pt < 0.5 GeV/c, see the figure 5.In the figure 2 the B values, the slopes of spectra, change, if we fit the data with a simple exponential function: exp(-B*pt).This exponential component might exist in other antiproton-reaction spectra as well, but it is not seen because of the absence of measurements in low pt’s.

The transverse momentum baryon spectra in antiproton-proton collisions (UA1, UA5, CDF) differ from the pt distributions of baryons in proton-proton collisions (ISR, STAR, LHC). 2 Preliminary Comparison of Hyperon Transverse Momentum Spectra from LHC Experiments The recent data on Λ0 hyperon distributions are obtained in the following LHC groups: ALICE 6 at 900 GeV, ATLAS 7 and CMS 8 at 900 GeV and 7 TeV. First, the fragmentation of antidiquark-diquark side of pomeron diagram makes the major contribution to baryon production spec- tra in the asymmetric p-p¯ reaction.

Word count: 3597
Abstract: We compare and contrast the emission of gravitational waves and waveforms forthe recently established "helicoidal-drifting-sequence" of a test particlearound a Kerr black hole with the publicly available waveform templates ofnumerical-relativity. The merger of two black holes of comparable mass areconsidered. We outline a final smooth merging of the test particle into thefinal Kerr black hole. We find a surprising and unexpected agreement betweenthe two treatments if we adopt, for the mass of the particle and the Kerr blackhole a Newtonian-center-of-mass description, and for the Kerr black hole spinan effective value whose nature remains to be clarified.Comment: Accepted for publication in JCA

Title: Interpretability via Model Extraction
Word count: 3325
Abstract: The ability to interpret machine learning models has become increasinglyimportant now that machine learning is used to inform consequential decisions.We propose an approach called model extraction for interpreting complex,blackbox models. Our approach approximates the complex model using a much moreinterpretable model; as long as the approximation quality is good, thenstatistical properties of the complex model are reflected in the interpretablemodel. We show how model extraction can be used to understand and debug randomforests and neural nets trained on several datasets from the UCI MachineLearning Repository, as well as control policies learned for several classicalreinforcement learning problems.Comment: Presented as a poster at the 2017 Workshop on Fairness,  Accountability, and Transparency in Machine Learning (FAT/ML 2017

Title: Thermodynamic Properties of Kehagias-Sfetsos Black Hole \& KS/CFT  Correspondence
Word count: 2953
Abstract: We speculate on various thermodynamic features of the innerhorizon~(${\mathcal H}^{-}$) and outer horizons~(${\mathcal H}^{+}$) ofKehagias-Sfetsos~(KS) black hole~(BH) in the background of Ho\v{r}ava Lifshitzgravity. We compute particularly the \emph{area product, area sum, area minusand area division} of the BH horizons. We find that they all are \emph{not}showing universal behavior whereas the product is a universal quantity~[Pradhan P., \textit{Phys. Lett. B}, {\bf 747} (2015) {64}]. Based on theserelations, we derive the area bound of all horizons. From the area bound wederive the entropy bound and irreducible mass bound for all thehorizons~(${\mathcal H}^{\pm}$). We also observe that the \emph{First law} ofBH thermodynamics and \emph {Smarr-Gibbs-Duhem } relations do not hold for thisBH. The underlying reason behind this failure due to the scale invariance ofthe coupling constant. Moreover, we compute the\emph{Cosmic-Censorship-Inequality} for this BH which gives the lower bound forthe total mass of the spacetime and it is supported by cosmic cencorshipconjecture. Finally, we discuss the KS/CFT~(Conformal Field Theory)correspondence via a thermodynamic procedure.Comment: Version accepted in EP

basic summary: Based on these relations, we computed area bound, entropy bound, irreducible mass bound, temperature bound and specific heat bound. It is also interesting to mentioned that except the area product, entropy product and irreducible mass product all the thermodynamic relations of KS BH are mass dependent. We speculated that area sum, area minus and area division are mass dependent quantities, whereas the product is a mass independent quantity. In our previous study , we derived the surface area product, BH entropy product, surface temperature product, Komar energy product and specific heat product for this BH. Besides the area or entropy product it should be known what happens in case of area sum, area minus and area division. (13) It is remarkable that the area product of KS BH is independent of mass but the area sum is not independent of the mass parameter. From area bound we derive entropy bound and irreducible mass bound for all the horizons (H±). From area bound we derive entropy bound and irreducible mass bound for both the horizons. Likewise, the entropy product and entropy sum of H± becomes: S−S+ = pi 2 4ω2 and S− + S+ = pi ( 4M2 − 1 ω ) . For this reason we extend our study by computing area sum, entropy sum, temperature sum and specific heat sum of all the horizons. We compute particularly area sum, area minus and area division of the BH horizons.

(39) and the entropy sum gives: pi ( 4M2 − 1 ω ) = S+ + S− ≥ S+ ≥ S+ + S− 2 = pi ( 2M2 − 1 2ω ) . Likewise, the entropy product [7] and entropy sum of H± becomes: S−S+ = pi 2 4ω2 and S− + S+ = pi ( 4M2 − 1 ω ) .

(16) and the minus of area inverse is computed to be 1 A± − 1A∓ = ∓4ω 2M pi √ M2 − 1 2ω . The product and sum of horizon radii becomes r+r− = 1 2ω and r+ + r− = 2M .

(26) It is in-fact a mass independent (universal) relation and implies that T+S+ = T−S− should be taken as a criterion whether there is a 2D CFT dual for the BHs in the Einstein gravity and other diffeomorphism gravity theories [11, 32]. We computed various thermodynamic formula for this BH. As long as M2 − 1 2ω ≥ 0 .

(2) Finally, for charged spinning BH, these relations should read off A+A− = (8piJ)2 + (4piQ2)2 or S+S− = (2piJ)2 + (piQ2)2 . In our previous study [7], we derived the surface area product, BH entropy product, surface temperature product, Komar energy product and specific heat product for this BH.

Title: The precision of parameter estimation for dephasing model under squeezed  reservoir
Word count: 3453
Abstract: We study the precision of parameter estimation for dephasing model undersqueezed environment. We analytically calculate the dephasing factor$\gamma(t)$ and obtain the analytic quantum Fisher information (QFI) for theamplitude parameter $\alpha$ and the phase parameter $\phi$. It is shown thatthe QFI for the amplitude parameter $\alpha$ is invariant in the whole process,while the QFI for the phase parameter $\phi$ strongly depends on the reservoirsqueezing. It is shown that the QFI can be enhanced for appropriate squeezeparameters $r$ and $\theta$. Finally, we also investigate the effect oftemperature on the QFI

basic summary: This shows that the squeeze phase parameter θ plays more significant role than the squeeze parameter r in this parameter estimation scheme. The environment ρbath is assumed to be the squeezed vacuum reservoir, which is given by ρbath = ∏ k Sk (r, θ) |0k〉 〈0k|Sk (r, θ) † . The competition between the squeeze parameter r and the squeeze phase parameter θ determines whether the QFI is enhanced or descended in the dephasing process. In this paper, we investigate the effects of reservoir squeez- ing on the estimation precision of the amplitude parameter α ∗Electronic address: quaninformation@sina.com and the phase parameter φ. We analytically calculate the dephasing factor γ(t) and obtain the analytic quantum Fisher information (QFI) for the amplitude parameter α and the phase parameter φ.

Title: A note on the Borwein conjecture
Word count: 2026
Abstract: A conjecture of Borwein asserts that for any positive integer $n$ and $k$,the coefficient $a_{3k}$ of $q^{3k}$ in the expansion of $\prod_{j=0}^n(1-q^{3j+1})(1-q^{3j+2})$ is nonnegative.  In this paper we prove that for any $0 \leq k\leq n$, there is a constant$0<c<1$ such that $a_{3k}+a_{3(n+1)+3k}+\cdots+a_{3n(n+1)+3k}=\frac {2\cdot3^{N/3}} {N}(1+O(c^N)).$  In particular, $a_{3k}+a_{3(n+1)+3k}+\cdots+a_{3n(n+1)+3k}>0.$Comment: 12 pages; proofs simplified and a bit more strong result adde

Title: Trajectory-based interpretation of laser light diffraction by a sharp  edge
Word count: 1351
Abstract: In the diffraction pattern produced by a half-plane sharp edge when itobstructs the passage of a laser beam, two characteristic regions arenoticeable. There is a central region, where it can be noticed the diffractionof laser light in the region of geometric shadow, while intensity oscillationsare observed in the non-obstructed area. On both sides of the edge, there arealso very long light traces along the normal to the edge of the obstacle. Thetheoretical explanation to this phenomenon is based on the Fresnel-Kirchhoffdiffraction theory applied to the Gaussian beam propagation behind theobstacle. Here we have supplemented this explanation by consideringelectromagnetic flow lines, which provide a more complete interpretation of thephenomenon in terms of electric and magnetic fields and flux lines, and thatcan be related, at the same time, with average photon paths.Comment: 13 pages, 5 figure

Title: The Newman--Shapiro problem
Word count: 1405
Abstract: We give a negative answer to the Newman--Shapiro problem on weightedapproximation for entire functions formulated in 1966 and motivated by thetheory of operators on the Fock space. There exists a function in the Fockspace such that its exponential multiples do not approximate some entiremultiples in the space. Furthermore, we establish several positive resultsunder different restrictions on the function in question.Comment: 28 page

Title: Coupling magneto-elastic Lagrangians to spin transfer torque sources
Word count: 3769
Abstract: The consequences of coupling magnetic and elastic degrees of freedom, wherespins and deformations are carried by point-like objects subject to localinteractions, are studied, theoretically and by detailed numerical simulations.From the constrained Lagrangians we derive consistent equations of motion forthe coupled dynamical variables. In order to probe the dynamics of such asystem, we consider external perturbations, such as spin transfer torques forthe magnetic part, and homogeneous stresses for the elastic part, associated totheir corresponding damping. This approach is applied to the study of ultrafastswitching processes in anti-ferromagnetic systems, which have recentlyattracted attention as candidates for anti-ferromagnetic spintronic devices.Our strategy is then checked in simple, but instructive, situations. We carriedout numerical experiments to study, in particular, how the magnetostrictivecoupling and external stresses affect the nature of the switching processes ina prototype anti-ferromagnetic material.Comment: 6 pages, LaTeX2e, 3 figures.

Title: Stabilization of the Peregrine soliton and Kuznetsov-Ma breathers by  means of nonlinearity and dispersion management
Word count: 3344
Abstract: We demonstrate a possibility to make rogue waves (RWs) in the form of thePeregrine soliton (PS) and Kuznetsov-Ma breathers (KMBs) effectively stableobjects, with the help of properly defined dispersion or nonlinearitymanagement applied to the continuous-wave (CW) background supporting the RWs.In particular, it is found that either management scheme, if applied along thelongitudinal coordinate, making the underlying nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation(NLSE) selfdefocusing in the course of disappearance of the PS, indeedstabilizes the global solution with respect to the modulational instability ofthe background. In the process, additional excitations are generated, namely,dispersive shock waves and, in some cases, also a pair of slowly separatingdark solitons. Further, the nonlinearity-management format, which makes theNLSE defocusing outside of a finite domain in the transverse direction, enablesthe stabilization of the KMBs, in the form of confined oscillating states. Onthe other hand, a nonlinearity-management format applied periodically along thepropagation direction, creates expanding patterns featuring multiplication ofKMBs through their cascading fission.Comment: Physics Letters A, on pres

Title: Determining the nature of white dwarfs from low-frequency gravitational  waves
Word count: 2458
Abstract: An extreme-mass-ratio system composed of a white dwarf (WD) and a massiveblack hole can be observed by the low-frequency gravitational wave detectors,such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). When the mass of theblack hole is around $10^4 \sim 10^5 M_\odot$, the WD will be disrupted by thetidal interaction at the final inspiraling stage. The event position and timeof the tidal disruption of the WD can be accurately determined by thegravitational wave signals. Such position and time depend upon the mass of theblack hole and especially on the density of the WD. We present the theory byusing LISA-like gravitational wave detectors, the mass-radius relation and thenthe equations of state of WDs could be strictly constrained (accuracy up to$0.1\%$). We also point out that LISA can accurately predict the disruptiontime of a WD, and forecast the electromagnetic follow-up of this tidaldisruption event.Comment: 7 pages, 2 figure

basic summary: Such position and time are determined by the mass and radius of WD and the mass of black hole. We find that the tidal radius is independent of the spin of the black hole (BH), but relates with the density of WD and mass of BH. The shadows with different color represent the range of mass and radius of compact object with a tidal disruption event seen by LISA. The measurement uncertainties of the masses of WD and black hole will also contribute to the measurement error of tidal disruption position. For a typical WD (µ = 2), we find that LISA can observe the tidal disruption of a small mass white dwarf (. When the mass of black hole is around 104 ∼ 105M , the WD will be disrupted by the tidal interaction at the final inspiralling stage.

Title: Strict n-categories and augmented directed complexes model homotopy  types
Word count: 1893
Abstract: In this paper we show that both the homotopy category of strict$n$-categories, $1\leqslant n \leqslant \infty$, and the homotopy category ofSteiner's augmented directed complexes are equivalent to the category ofhomotopy types. In order to do so, we first prove an abstract result, based ona strategy of Fritsch and Latch, giving sufficient conditions for a nervefunctor with values in simplicial sets to induce an equivalence at the level ofhomotopy categories. We then apply this result to strict $n$-categories andaugmented directed complexes, for which the hypothesis of our theorem wereestablished by Ara and Maltsiniotis

basic summary: We shall call weak equivalences of ∆̂ the usual weak homotopy equivalences and weak equivalences of ∆̂′ the morphisms such that their image by i! This definition provides us with an induced nerve functor at the level of the homotopy categories, that is the categories in which we localise at weak equivalences. We call weak equivalences of Cda the morphisms whose image by N is a weak equivalence of ∆̂.

The functor N : Cda → ∆̂ induces an equivalence at the level of the homotopy categories. For any m such that 1 6 m 6 ∞, the functor Nm : m-Cat → ∆̂ induces an equivalence at the level of the homotopy categories.

In this paper we show that both the homotopy category of strict n-categories, 1 6 n 6 ∞, and the homotopy category of Steiner’s augmented directed complexes are equivalent to the category of homotopy types. In the same article, they also conjectured that for every n such that 1 6 n 6∞, the Street nerve induces an equivalence of homotopy categories between n-Cat and simplicial sets and that the same holds for augmented directed complexes with their own nerve functor.

Title: Enhanced Local Binary Patterns for Automatic Face Recognition
Word count: 2938
Abstract: This paper presents a novel automatic face recognition approach based onlocal binary patterns. This descriptor considers a local neighbourhood of apixel to compute the feature vector values. This method is not very robust tohandle image noise, variances and different illumination conditions. We addressthese issues by proposing a novel descriptor which considers more pixels anddifferent neighbourhoods to compute the feature vector values. The proposedmethod is evaluated on two benchmark corpora, namely UFI and FERET facedatasets. We experimentally show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-artmethods and is efficient particularly in the real conditions where the abovementioned issues are obvious. We further show that the proposed method handleswell one training sample issue and is also robust to the image resolution.Comment: Submitted for VCIP 201

Title: Hand Segmentation for Hand-Object Interaction from Depth map
Word count: 2893
Abstract: Hand segmentation for hand-object interaction is a necessary preprocessingstep in many applications such as augmented reality, medical application, andhuman-robot interaction. However, typical methods are based on colorinformation which is not robust to objects with skin color, skin pigmentdifference, and light condition variations. Thus, we propose hand segmentationmethod for hand-object interaction using only a depth map. It is challengingbecause of the small depth difference between a hand and objects during aninteraction. To overcome this challenge, we propose the two-stage randomdecision forest (RDF) method consisting of detecting hands and segmentinghands. To validate the proposed method, we demonstrate results on the publiclyavailable dataset of hand segmentation for hand-object interaction. Theproposed method achieves high accuracy in short processing time comparing tothe other state-of-the-art methods

basic summary: In this paper, we propose the hand segmentation method for hand-object interaction using only a depth map to avoid the limitations of skin color-based methods. Thus, we propose hand segmentation method for hand-object interaction using only a depth map. At each leaf node, the algorithm stores the conditional probability p(h|l) (probability of being each class h given reaching the node l) for the prediction in a testing stage. B. Kang, Y. Lee, and T.

CONCLUSION In this paper, we present two-stage RDF method for hand seg- mentation for hand-object interaction using only a depth map. The proposed method is compared with the RDF-based method in [1,19] and the fully convolutional networks (FCN) in [24, 25] using only a depth map. Using the inputs (x,D), the algorithm learns a split func- tion at each splitting node and a conditional probability distri- bution at each leaf node.

Title: Simple set cardinality estimation through random sampling
Word count: 1141
Abstract: We present a simple algorithm that estimates the cardinality $n$ of a set $V$when allowed to sample elements of $V$ uniformly and independently at random.Our algorithm with probability $(1-\delta)$ returns a$(1\pm\epsilon)-$approximation of $n$ drawing $O\big(\sqrt{n} \cdot\epsilon^{-1}\sqrt{\log(\delta^{-1})}\big)$ samples (for$\epsilon^{-1}\sqrt{\log(\delta^{-1})} = O(\sqrt{n})$).Comment: 3 page

Title: Stability and causality of multi-local theories
Word count: 3133
Abstract: The regularized theories are non-local at the scale of the cutoff, leading soto the usual difficulties of non-local theories. In this work the conservationlaws and causality are investigated for classical field theories withmulti-cluster action. The conservation laws are found to play a lesssignificant role than in local theories because due to the non-locality theconserved quantities are not integrals of the motion, and they can exist evenwithout underlying symmetries. Moreover, the conservation of the energy can notprevent instability brought about by the unbounded nature of the energy frombelow. Hence a sufficient condition of stability is lost. Theories, obtained byappropriate point splitting of local interactions are shown to be causalthereby a necessary condition of stability can be retained.Comment: final version, to appear in Eur. Phys.

Abstract: The refraction index of the quantized lossy composite right-left handedtransmission line (CRLH-TL) is deduced in the thermal coherence state. Theresults show that the negative refraction index (herein the left-handedness)can be implemented by the electric circuit dissipative factors(i.e., theresistances \(R\) and conductances \( G\)) in a higher frequency band(1.446GHz\(\leq\omega\leq \) 15GHz), and flexibly adjusted by the left-handedcircuit components (\(C_l\), \(L_l\)) and the right-handed circuit components(\(C_r\), \(L_r\)) at a lower frequency (\(\omega\)=0.995GHz) . The flexibleadjustment for left-handedness in a wider bandwidth will be significant for themicroscale circuit design of the CRLH-TL and may make the theoreticalpreparation for its compact applications.Comment: 8 pages, 7 figure

Here we contribute a thorough analysis of 13state-of-the-art, commonly used machine learning algorithms on a set of 165publicly available classification problems in order to provide data-drivenalgorithm recommendations to current researchers. We present a number ofstatistical and visual comparisons of algorithm performance and quantify theeffect of model selection and algorithm tuning for each algorithm and dataset.The analysis culminates in the recommendation of five algorithms withhyperparameters that maximize classifier performance across the testedproblems, as well as general guidelines for applying machine learning tosupervised classification problems.Comment: 12 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables.

basic summary: Finally, we analyze how algorithms cluster across the tested problems, and present a set of algorithms that maximize performance across the datasets in Section 3.3. The rankings show the strength of ensemble-based tree algorithms in generating accurate models: The first, second, and fourth-ranked algorithms belong to this class of algorithms. The algorithms include Na¨ıve Bayes algorithms, common linear classifiers, tree-based al- gorithms, distance-based classifiers, ensemble algorithms, and non-linear, kernel-based strate- gies. We present a number of statistical and visual comparisons of algorithm performance and quantify the effect of model selection and algorithm tuning for each algorithm and dataset.

text_rank summary: The goal was to represent the most common classes of algorithms used in literature, as well as recent state-of-the-art algorithms such as Gradient Tree Boosting.10 For each algorithm, the hyperparameters were tuned using a fixed grid search with 10- fold cross-validation.In this use case, bioinformaticians may value the interpretability of the ML model, in which case black box predictive models that cannot be interpreted are of little use.18 Although the lo- gistic regression and decision tree algorithms are often outperformed by tree-based ensemble algorithms in terms of predictive accuracy (Figure 2), linear models and shallow decision trees often provide a useful trade-off between predictive accuracy and interpretability.Effect of Tuning and Model Selection Most ML algorithms contain several hyperparameters that can affect performance significantly (for example, the max tree depth of a decision tree classifier).Support Vector Machines and Gradient Tree Boosting appear to be quite different algorithms, but given that both are able to capture nonlinear interactions between variables, it is less surprising that they cluster as well.Algorithm Performance As a simple bulk measure to compare the performance of the 13 ML algorithms, we plot the mean rankings of the algorithms across all datasets in Figure 1.

Title: Motion of a rod pushed at one point in a weightless environment in space
Word count: 2446
Abstract: We analyze the motion of a rod floating in a weightless environment in spacewhen a force is applied at some point on the rod in a direction perpendicularto its length. If the force applied is at the centre of mass, then the rod getsa linear motion perpendicular to its length. However, if the same force isapplied at a point other than the centre of mass, say, near one end of the rod,thereby giving rise to a torque, then there will also be a rotation of the rodabout its centre of mass, in addition to the motion of the centre of massitself. If the force applied is for a very short duration, but impartingnevertheless a finite impulse, like in a sudden (quick) hit at one end of therod, then the centre of mass will move with a constant linear speed andsuperimposed on it will be a rotation of the rod with constant angular speedabout the centre of mass. However, if force is applied continuously, say bystrapping a tiny rocket at one end of the rod, then the rod will spin fasterand faster about the centre of mass, with angular speed increasing linearlywith time. As the direction of the applied force, as seen by an external(inertial) observer, will be changing continuously with the rotation of therod, the acceleration of the centre of mass would also be not in one fixeddirection. However, it turns out that the locus of the velocity vector of thecentre of mass will describe a Cornu spiral, with the velocity vector reachinga final constant value with time. The mean motion of the centre of mass will bein a straight line, with superposed initial oscillations that soon die down.Comment: 8 pages, 4 figures, to appear in Physics Educatio

basic summary: With the rotation of the rod, the direction of force f , which is assumed to be always perpendicular to the rod, will change continuously. The centre of mass C of the rod moves with a constant linear velocity v along the y direction. Suppose a force f is applied at some point on the rod, in a direction perpendicular to the length of the rod. But with the rotation of the rod, as the direction of force turns towards the −x direction, C picks up velocity in that direction. If the force applied is at the centre of mass, then the rod gets a linear motion perpendicular to its length. Therefore with respect to C, A has a speed v along y direction while B has a speed v in the opposite direction (Fig. In order to provide a continuous force perpendicular to the length of the rod, we could strap a tiny rocket to the rod at a point of our choosing. In addition, the rod rotates with a constant angular speed ω = 6v/l about C. end of the rod.

sim_matrix summary: As a result, the centre of mass C of the system moves with a velocity v = p/m along y direction, with a kinetic energy of translation K1 = mv 2/2 = p2/2m. The centre of mass C of the rod will be moving along the direction of the given impulse with a constant velocity v = p/m with the rod simultaneously spinning about C with an angular frequency ω = 6v/l (Fig. Of course, if the force is applied at the centre of mass C, then δ = 0 and ω = 0, i.e., the rod does not rotate and from Eq. On the other hand the kinetic energy of rotation, K2 = Iω 2/2 = 6f 2δ2t2/ml2, will be increasing indefinitely with time, with the rod spinning faster and faster about C. Assuming the centre of mass C of the rod to be at rest (i.e., v = 0) at the origin (x = 0, y = 0) at t = 0, the position of C, as a function of time, can be determined from the generic formula x(t) = ∫ t 0 v dt = v(t) t− ∫ t 0 a t dt. 1b) and these two together constitute a rotation about C. The kinetic energy associated with this rotation about C is K2 = Iω 2/2, (2) where I = 2(l/2)2m/2 = ml2/4 and ω = 2v/l respectively are the moment of inertia and angular speed of rotation about the centre of mass C. Substituting for I and ω in Eq. But in addition there is a torque N = fδ, about C, for time ∆t that gives rise to an angular momentum J = Iω = ml2ω/12 = N∆t = pδ, about C. From this we can readily see that the rod would rotate around C with an angular speed ω = 12pδ/ml2. The centre of mass C then moves with a velocity v = p/m. However, if the force is applied at the centre of mass C, with δ = 0, then from Eqs.

tfidf summary: However, if the same force is applied at a point other than the centre of mass, say, near one end of the rod, thereby giving rise to a torque, then there will also be a rotation of the rod about its centre of mass, in addition to the motion of the centre of mass itself. If the force applied is for a very short duration, but imparting nevertheless a finite impulse, like in a sudden (quick) hit at one end of the rod, then the centre of mass will move with a constant linear speed and superimposed on it will be a rotation of the rod with constant angular speed about the centre of mass. But this accounts for only half of the total kinetic energy of the system, i.e., K1 = K/2. (a) Particle A, with mass m/2, is given an impulse p, so that it moves with a constant velocity vA = 2p/m. ? We could imagine the rod (as well as the observer) to be freely floating in space, say, in a weightless environment within a satellite orbiting the Earth (and thus freely falling in Earth’s gravitational field) which can then be considered to be an inertial frame, provided any tidal effects over the system dimensions due to Earth’s gravitation field could be ignored. One expects the combined motion to be quite complicated. However, if force is applied continuously, say by strapping a tiny rocket at one end of the rod, then the rod will spin faster and faster about the centre of mass, with angular speed increasing linearly with time.

However, if the same force is applied at a point other than the centre of mass, then in addition to the motion of the centre of mass as before, there could also be a rotation of the rod about C, due to a finite torque [5, 6, 7]. Actually, the system possesses also a rotation about C. This is because while A has a velocity 2v along y direction, B is stationary, and C has a velocity v along y direction.

Abstract: In this paper, we formulate the deep residual network (ResNet) as a controlproblem of transport equation. In ResNet, the transport equation is solvedalong the characteristics. Based on this observation, deep neural network isclosely related to the control problem of PDEs on manifold. We propose severalmodels based on transport equation and Hamilton-Jacobi equation.

tfidf summary: If the control problem (8) is still solved along the characteristics, we need the initial value has an explicit form. We can further simplify the model by considering the steady Fokker-Planck equation. The simplest way is to choose S at random. ResNet can be formulated as solving a control problem of trans- port equation along the characteristics. Otherwise, the solution will be too smooth to fit the data due to the viscosity.

Title: Fluctuation-dissipation in accelerated frames
Word count: 3424
Abstract: An uniformly accelerated (Rindler) observer will detect particles in theMinkowski vacuum, known as Unruh effect. The spectrum is thermal and thetemperature is given by that of the Killing horizon, which is proportional tothe acceleration. Considering these particles are kept in a thermal bath withthis temperature, we find that the correlation function of the random force dueto radiation acting on the particles as measured by the accelerated frame,shows the fluctuation-dissipation relation. It is observed that thecorrelations, in both ($1+1$) spacetime and ($1+3$) dimensional spacetimes, areof Brownian type. We discuss the implications of this new observation at theend.Comment: The para above Eq. (6) has been modified, to appear in Phys. Rev.

basic summary: Hence for our practical purpose we keep our region of integra- tion from X = X(T ) to X →∞. Following the steps of , we obtain F (T ) = −X ′(T )T 01[T,X(T )] + T 00[T,X(T )] , (2) where X ′(T ) = dX/dT . 3Then, it follows that the the correlation function of the random force is dependant upon the correlation function of the spacetime derivatives of the scalar field. Therefore, the observer moves from X = X(T ), which is given by the equation for the path, to∞. Correlation Function in Minkowski Spacetime: The correlation function is determined by taking the aver- age of product of the random force amplitudes at two different time-points T1 and T2. (10), that x˜0 = x01 − x 0 2 is finite while x˜ 1 = x11 − x 1 2 is very small. Here, the integration spans from X = X(T ) to ∞.

sim_matrix summary: C. Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem in Time Domain: In the time domain, the fluctuation-dissipation theorem rep- resents the relation between the correlation function of the random fluctuating force to the coefficient [say α] of the mean dissipative force, as [1, 2, 17] α = β lim ω→0 K˜(ω) 2 , (21) where K˜(ω) is the Fourier modes of correlation function which is given by (18). Fluctuating force and correlation in Minkowski spacetime: In this section, we will compute the correlation function of the random force in the (1 + 1)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime by first taking a definition of the reaction force on the particle due to its interaction with the scalar field bath. Correlation Function in Rindler Spacetime: The rela- tions between the Minkowski and Rindler coordinates in proper time τ are T = 1 a sinh(aτ); X = 1 a cosh(aτ) − 1 a , (10) where a is the acceleration. Correlation function in Rindler frame and fluctuation-dissipation theorem: Since the particles are observed from the accelerated frame, to determine the behaviour of these particles we need to write the correla- tion function (4) in Rindler proper time coordintes. (4) can be de- termined from the Schwinger function, the most general form of which is given by [7] Smnrs(x 1, x 2) = 〈Tmn[x 1]Trs[x 2]〉 = A( x˜ 2 )4 [(3gmngrs − gmrgns − gmsgnr) (x˜ 2)2 − 4x˜2 (gmnx˜rx˜s + grsx˜mx˜n) + 8x˜mx˜nx˜rx˜s] , (5) where A is an arbitrary constant, related to the central charge C of the particular fields by A = C/4π2, x˜a = xa1 − x a 2 and x˜ 2 = −(x01 − x 0 2) 2 + (x11 − x 1 2) 2. 3Then, it follows that the the correlation function of the random force is dependant upon the correlation function of the spacetime derivatives of the scalar field. It has been observed that the correlation function for the random force acting on the particles, in the very small accelera- tion regime, obey fluctuation-dissipation theorem which exists in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.

Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem in Time Domain: In the time domain, the fluctuation-dissipation theorem rep- resents the relation between the correlation function of the random fluctuating force to the coefficient [say α] of the mean dissipative force, as [1, 2, 17] α = β lim ω→0 K˜(ω) 2 , (21) where K˜(ω) is the Fourier modes of correlation function which is given by (18). Correlation function in Rindler frame and fluctuation-dissipation theorem: Since the particles are observed from the accelerated frame, to determine the behaviour of these particles we need to write the correla- tion function (4) in Rindler proper time coordintes. Hence, it can be safely said that the correlation func- tion of the random force is related to the correlation function of the energy-momentum tensor. Considering these particles are kept in a thermal bath with this temperature, we find that the symmetric and anti-symmetric combinations of correlation function for the random force, acting of them, satisfies the fluctuation-dissipation theorem in the small acceleration limit. C. Determining the energy-momentum tensor correla- tions: The correlation functions of the energy-momentum tensor components that appears in eq. The Langevin equation shows that the driving force behind the motion of the immersed particle can be decomposed into three parts - (a) the external force exerted by external agents that the particle is subjected to, (b) the slowly-varying averaged force that tends to drive the system to an equilibrium state, and (c) the rapidly fluctuating random force.

frequency summary: Keeping this in mind and us- ing the expression (3) for random force at two different spacetime points x 1(X1, T1) and x 2(X2, T2), we get the expression for the correlation function to be 〈R(T1)R(T2)〉 = X ′ 1(T1)X ′ 2(T2) 〈 T 01[x 1]T 01[x 2] 〉 −X ′1(T1) 〈 T 01[x 1]T 00[x 2] 〉 −X ′2(T2) 〈 T 00[x 1]T 01[x 2] 〉 + 〈 T 00[x 1]T 00[x 2] 〉 (4) where one needs to keep in mind that after calculation one has to use X1 = X1(T1) and so on.

(12) Rewriting the expression in terms of the two points x 1(x 1 1, T1) and x 2(x 1 2, T2) again, the above equation be- comes 〈R(T1)R(T2)〉 = A [ −(T1 − T2)2 + (X1(T1)−X2(T2))2] 2 . Fluctuating force and correlation in Minkowski spacetime: In this section, we will compute the correlation function of the random force in the (1 + 1)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime by first taking a definition of the reaction force on the particle due to its interaction with the scalar field bath.

Title: A simple but tough-to-beat baseline for the Fake News Challenge stance  detection task
Word count: 1890
Abstract: Identifying public misinformation is a complicated and challenging task. Animportant part of checking the veracity of a specific claim is to evaluate thestance different news sources take towards the assertion. Automatic stanceevaluation, i.e. stance detection, would arguably facilitate the process offact checking. In this paper, we present our stance detection system whichclaimed third place in Stage 1 of the Fake News Challenge. Despite ourstraightforward approach, our system performs at a competitive level with thecomplex ensembles of the top two winning teams. We therefore propose our systemas the 'simple but tough-to-beat baseline' for the Fake News Challenge stancedetection task.Comment: 6 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables; additional reference and details added,  typos and wording correcte

basic summary: 2 Model description Our stance detection model is a single, end-to-end system consisting of lexical and similarity features fed through a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with one hidden layer. More specifically, FNC-1 involved developing a model that, given a news article headline and a news article body, estimates the stance of the body towards the headline. We therefore propose our model as the ‘simple but tough-to-beat baseline’ for the Fake News Challenge stance detection task. The performance of our model is summarised by below confusion matrix for the label predictions submitted on the final test set (see Table 2). In this paper, we present our stance detection model which claimed third place in the first stage of the Fake News Challenge. 2.4 Hyperparameters The full set of hyperparameters of the model, their labels, their descriptions, the ranges of values considered, and corresponding optimised values are provided in Table 1. 2 2.3 Training Our training objective was to minimise the cross entropy between the model’s softmax probabilities and the true labels.

Title: Determination of Boltzmann constant by equipartition theorem for  capacitors
Word count: 1260
Abstract: A new experimental set-up for Boltzmann constant measurement is described.Statistically averaged square of voltage $\left<U^2\right>$ is measured fordifferent capacitances $C$. Boltzmann constant is determined by theequipartition theorem $C\left<U^2\right>=k_{_\mathrm{B}}T$. For fixedcapacitance, voltages could be measured for different temperatures. The set-upconsists of low-noise high frequency operational amplifiers ADA4898-2. Aninstrumental amplifier is followed by an inverting amplifier, square of thevoltage is created by an analog multiplier AD633 and finally the averagedsignal is measured by a multimeter.Comment: 14 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables, 2 appendice

basic summary: Statistically averaged square of voltage 〈 U2 〉 is measured for different capacitances C. Boltzmann constant is determined by the equipartition theorem C 〈 U2 〉 = kBT . The purpose of the present work is to present a simple self- made set-up for determination of Boltzmann constant in high- school and student laboratories. The prob- lem of the floating of the zero is solved with large fast capac- itors sequentially connected to the gain resistors of the circuit depicted at Fig. Table of the calculated parameters necessary for the anal- ysis of the circuit (time constants, frequencies, voltages and lin- ear amplification). One can easily see the 2 dual ADA48986 operational amplifiers in a SOIC package, the 3 large WIMA capacitors,7 and the multiplier AD6334 in a PDIP package.

frequency summary: Update February 6, 2009: During the fall, 2008, Josh Greene reported that new results of his, based on a combination of tools com- ing from Heegaard-Floer theory and Donaldson’s original restrictions on the intresection forms of smooth manifolds, are sufficient to rule out unknotting number 1 for the remaining 100 cases for 11 alternat- ing crossing knots. Update January 15, 2006: The last remaining unknown case for 10 crossing knots, that of 1051 was resolved by Selahi Durusoy, who observed that a single crossing change results in the slice knot 88.

Title: A General and Adaptive Robust Loss Function
Word count: 2027
Abstract: We present a generalization of the Cauchy/Lorentzian, Geman-McClure,Welsch/Leclerc, generalized Charbonnier, Charbonnier/pseudo-Huber/L1-L2, and L2loss functions. By introducing robustness as a continous parameter, our lossfunction allows algorithms built around robust loss minimization to begeneralized, which improves performance on basic vision tasks such asregistration and clustering. Interpreting our loss as the negative log of aunivariate density yields a general probability distribution that includesnormal and Cauchy distributions as special cases. This probabilisticinterpretation enables the training of neural networks in which the robustnessof the loss automatically adapts itself during training, which improvesperformance on learning-based tasks such as generative image synthesis andunsupervised monocular depth estimation, without requiring any manual parametertuning

basic summary: Our loss is valid for all real values of α and for all real, positive values of c. The loss increases monotonically with the magnitude of x. In this paper we present a single loss function that is a superset of many of these com- mon loss functions. Loss Function With this analysis in place, we can present our final loss function. As as result, this loss may be useful to practitioners wishing to easily and continuously explore a wide variety of robust loss functions.

sim_matrix summary: The generalized Charbonnier loss builds upon the Charbonnier loss function [3], which is generally defined as: f (x, c) = √ x2 + c2 (1) This loss sometimes is written in a reparameterized form: f (x, c) = c √ (x/c) 2 + 1 (2) This form of the loss is sometimes referred to as “L1-L2” loss (as it behaves like quadratic loss near the origin and like absolute loss far from the origin) or a Pseudo-Huber loss (due to its resemblance to the classic Huber loss func- tion [7]). ρ (x, α, c) = log ( 1 2 ( x/c) 2 + 1 ) if α = 0 1− exp ( − 12 (x/c)2 ) if α = −∞ z(α) α (( (x/c)2 z(α) + 1 )(α/2) − 1 ) otherwise (13) z(α) = max (1, 2− α) (14) As we have shown, this loss function is a superset of the generalized Charbonnier loss function (and therefore the the Charbonnier / L1-L2 / pseudo-Huber, quadratic and ab- solute loss functions by transitivity) and is also a superset of the Cauchy / Lorentzian, Geman-McClure, and Welsch / Leclerc loss functions. As is already well-known, L2 loss is a special case of the generalized Charbonnier, and this remains true in our reparametrization: h (x, 2, c) = 1 2 (x/c) 2 (8) Though L1 loss is a special case of the generalized Char- bonnier loss in it’s traditional form, true L1 loss is not actu- ally expressible in our normalized form in Equation 6 due to the division by c. But if we assume that x is much greater than c, we see that our normalized form approaches L1 loss: h (x, 1, c) ≈ |x| c − 1 if x c (9) Unlike the generalized Charbonnier loss, our normalized loss can be shown to be a generalization of two other com- mon loss functions. By setting α = −2, our loss is equivalent to Geman-McClure loss [5]: h (x,−2, c) = 2 ( x/c) 2 (x/c) 2 + 4 (11) And in the limit as α approaches negative infinity, our loss becomes Welsch [9] (aka Leclerc [11]) loss: lim α→−∞h (x, α, c) = 1− exp ( −1 2 (x/c) 2 ) (12) The Welsch and Geman-McClure losses are therefore spe- cial cases of our loss, or equivalently, our loss function can be viewed as a generalization of the Welsch and Geman- McClure loss functions.

Title: A simple formula for a planet's mean annual insolation by latitude
Word count: 1624
Abstract: In this paper, we use a sixth order Legendre series expansion to approximatethe mean annual insolation by latitude of a planet with obliquity angle$\beta$, leading to faster computations with little loss in the accuracy ofresults. We discuss differences between our method and selected computationalresults for insolation found in the literature.Comment: 5 pages, 2 figure

basic summary: The precession dependence for annual insolation averages out over the course of a year because of their assumption that precession is constant over this time period. In the following section we show how the method for section 2 compares with the results from two different computer programs designed to calculate insolation by latitude.

Title: Diffusion-like recommendation with enhanced similarity of objects
Word count: 3833
Abstract: In last decades, diversity and accuracy have been regarded as two importantmeasures in evaluating a recommendation model. However, a clear concern is thata model focusing excessively on one measure will put the other one at risk,thus it is not easy to greatly improve diversity and accuracy simultaneously.In this paper, we propose to enhance the Resource-Allocation (RA) similarity inresource transfer equations of diffusion-like models, by giving a tunableexponent to the RA similarity, and traversing the value of the exponent toachieve the optimal recommendation results. In this way, we can increase therecommendation scores (allocated resource) of many unpopular objects.Experiments on three benchmark data sets, MovieLens, Netflix, and RateYourMusicshow that the modified models can yield remarkable performance improvementcompared with the original ones

basic summary: A random recommendation will randomly choose L objects from the train set and recommend them to the target user, where L is the length of the recommendation list. The niche objects will receive lower final resources (recommendation scores) because they have fewer neighbor users (resource portals), thus rank in the bottom of the recommendation lists.

Title: Three lessons from the Czech presidential election
Word count: 218
Abstract: Miloš Zeman won a second term as Czech President on 27 January, narrowly defeating opposition candidate Jiří Drahoš. Jan Rovny writes that the country is now sharply divided between two political blocs that cut across old left-right allegiances, with identity politics playing an increasingly important role in shaping support. The presidential election also underlined that Czech politics is likely to take another step closer to Poland and Hungary, but with the key distinction that the country’s liberal opposition has shown an ability to unite against Zeman and garner almost 50% of the vote

Title: REVIEW SENYAWA ANTIBAKTERI PADA KOPI SANGRAI
Word count: 1586
Abstract: Kopi sangrai merupakan salah satu bahan minuman yang telah diketahui potensinya sebagai antibakteri untuk menghambat ataupun membunuh bakteri. Kemampuan antibakteri ini diketahui efektif terhadap berbagai jenis bakteri patogen, seperti Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli dan Streptococcus mutans (bakteri yang diketahui tumbuh dalam mulut manusia). Aktivitas antibakteri ini dapat meningkat jika kopi disangrai dalam waktu yang lebih lama ataupun pada suhu yang lebih tinggi. Hal ini disebabkan adanya senyawa melanoidin dan alfa dikarbonil yang dihasilkan dalam reaksi Maillard selama proses penyangraian. Selain dari itu, aktivitas antibakteri juga didapati pada berbagai senyawa fenolik dan kafein yang ada pada kopi sangrai. Sehubungan dengan adanya berbagai senyawa antibakteri pada kopi sangrai, maka diperlukan review untuk merangkum publikasi yang telah diterbitkan mengenai berbagai senyawa antibakteri pada kopi sangrai. Hal tersebut menjadi tujuan penulis dalam menulis review. Berdasarkan berbagai jenis senyawa antibakteri pada kopi sangrai, diketahui bahwa salah satu isomer dari asam klorogenat (5-caffeoylquinic acid) memiliki potensi antibakteri yang lebih tinggi dari senyawa fenolik lainnya. Asam klorogenat mampu mengubah nilai pH pada membran bakteri. Senyawa trigonelline dan kafein didapati memiliki aktivitas antibakteri yang lemah terhadap sebagian besar dari bakteri patogen. Kafein ditemukan memiliki kemampuan untuk meningkatkan aktivitas antibakteri dari senyawa lain, seperti senyawa alfa dikarbonil. Senyawa alfa dikarbonil dan melanoidin telah dikenal memiliki aktivitas antibakteri yang tinggi. Hal ini dipengaruhi oleh rendahnya nilai pH pada senyawa alfa dikarbonil (1,92 untuk methylglyoxal; 2,10 untuk glyoxal) dan kemampuan melanoidin untuk mengikat kation yang menstabilkan membran bakteri. Selain dari itu, melanoidin juga diketahui dapat mengikat kation yang terkandung dalam media sehingga tidak dapat dikonsumsi oleh bakteri. Dalam aplikasinya terhadap bakteri patogen, kopi sangrai beserta dengan senyawa antibakterinya didapati lebih efektif terhadap bakteri gram positif dibandingkan bakteri gram negatif. Beberapa senyawa antibakteri diketahui memiliki efektifitas terhadap bakteri tertentu, seperti efektifitas dari senyawa melanoidin terhadap bakteri yang dapat membentuk suatu kompleks dengan zat besi sebagai perlindungan terhadap sel (siderophore). Senyawa trigonelline juga diketahui memiliki efektifitas terhadap bakteri yang diketahui tumbuh dalam mulut dan menyebabkan peradangan pada gusi manusia

Word count: 186
Abstract: Di era yang serba modern ini, sebagian besar orang tidak luput dari penggunaan teknologi dalam menjalankan aktifitasnya. Dengan dibantu oleh teknologi maka pekerjaan dapat diselesaikan jauh lebih cepat dibanding tanpa menggunakan bantuan teknologi. Perkembangan teknologi sendiri diharapkan dapat mempermudah para pelaku usaha dalam menjalankan usahanya. Salah satu contoh dari teknologi tersebut yaitu teknologi informasi akuntansi berbasis komputer. Teknologi informasi akuntansi berbasis komputer berguna untuk mempermudah proses pengumpulan, pengolahan, menyusun, menyimpan dan memanipulasi data untuk menghasilkan informasi yang relevan, akurat dan tepat waktu. Dalam menjalankan bisnisnya, para pelaku bisnis juga membutuhkan penerapan teknologi informasi akuntansi berbasis komputer pada bisnisnya supaya proses bisnis berjalan lebih efektif dan efisien. Penelitian ini dilakukan di Pabrik Tahu Siliwangi yang dalam menjalankan kegiatan usahanya belum menggunakan sistem teknologi informasi akuntansi, melainkan masih menggunakan sistem pencatatan secara manual. Oleh karena itu, penulis melakukan analisis dan juga merancang sistem informasi akuntansi berbasis teknologi informasi akuntansi pada tempat usaha tersebut dengan menggunakan metode Model Driven Development (MDD). Tahapan yang dilakukan dalam proses perancangan sistem meliputi; tahap identifikasi masalah, analisis masalah, analisis kebutuhan sistem dan yang terakhir adalah tahap desain (desain data, desain proses dan desain interface). Pada tahap desain data akan dibuat Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). Pada tahap desain proses akan dilakukan pengolahan data dari input menjadi output berupa Data Flow Diagram (DFD). Pada tahap desain interface akan dibuat sistem desain tampilan awal program, baik input maupun output

Title: Pengaruh Management Changes, Financial Distress, Audit Tenure, Reputasi Auditor, Ukuran Perusahaan Klien, dan Kondisi Keuangan Perusahaan Terhadap Auditor Switching
Word count: 1238
Abstract: Penelitian ini menganalisis faktor-faktor yang mempengaruhi auditor switching pada semua perusahaan yang terdaftar di Bursa Efek Indonesia (BEI) tahun 2009-2013. Faktor yang diuji dalam penelitian ini antara lain management changes, financial distress, audit tenure, reputasi auditor, ukuran perusahaan klien, kondisi keuangan perusahaan, growth, dan perubahan ROA. Penelitian ini menggunakan metode purposive sampling dan menggunakan alat analisis multivariat dengan menggunakan regresi logistik (logistic regression). Hasil dari penelitian ini menunjukkan bahwa Audit Tenure memiliki pengaruh yang signifikan terhadap Auditor Switching. Sedangkan management changes, financial distress, reputasi auditor, ukuran perusahaan klien, growth, dan perubahan ROA tidak memiliki pengaruh terhadap auditor switching. Kata kunci: management changes, financial distress, audit tenure, reputasi auditor, ukuran perusahaan klien, kondisi keuangan perusahaan, growth, dan perubahan ROA, auditor switching

Title: Radiocarbon dating of mortar: Case study of the Aqueduct in Skopje
Word count: 87
Abstract: Dating of mortar has been a challenge since the early days of the radiocarbon dating method. The idea is to date only the carbon fixed in mortar at the time of binding (i.e., the binder). However, results of ¹⁴C mortar dating are often compromised with dead carbon contamination originating from unreacted limestone during preparation of quick lime. Also, non-binder carbon can be incorporated into mortar sample (1) due to precipitation of secondary carbonates from environment, (2) in case of fire accidents, it is replaced with the carbon from the atmosphere at the time of accident, or (3) if the mortar is too alkaline, it still incorporates carbon from the atmosphere. Therefore, an effort is placed into developing of a method that can isolate strictly the binder carbon, with the help of the accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) measurement technique enabling analyses of various phases of mortar. However, no reliable procedure has yet been established for each mortar type (Hajdas et al., 2017). The Zagreb Radiocarbon Laboratory was approached with a request to determinate time of the Aqueduct in Skopje (FYR Macedonia) construction through ¹⁴C dating of mortar samples. The Aqueduct is one of the landmarks of Skopje, a monumental building more than 385 m long. It was a part of a water-supply system with a total length of about 10 km. The age of the Aqueduct is not known – several hypotheses place it to periods between 6th and 16th century. Six mortar samples from different positions of the eastern façade and the upper parts with remains of tubes were collected in July 2017, paying attention that samples were not deteriorated and were situated at higher levels with less possibility of containing the secondary carbon. In the Laboratory, the maximum 5 cm of the mortar from the surface was subsampled, than broken by alternately changing temperatures from -198 °C to 80 °C. In order to extract only the carbon from the binder three strategies for separation of binder carbon were used: 1) mechanical separation of calcite inclusions formed during mortar hardening (not possible for all mortars), 2) selection on the basis of particle size and the ability to suspend in water induced by ultrasonic shock, and 3) collection of at least two fractions of CO₂ produced by reaction of calcite with acid. With the premise that all mortars originated from the same era, the results of ¹⁴C dating of each fraction were combined to yield a plausible date of the Aqueduct building. Some results were eliminated due to very low δ¹³C values combined with modern ¹⁴C dates and some implied dead carbon contamination. The most reliable results were obtained from two inclusions and one suspended fraction placing the time of the Aqueduct construction in 15-16 century AD. The analyses will be presented and possibility of using the method for future mortar dating will be discussed. References Hajdas et al. 2017.

Title: Interlaboratory comparison of H-3 and C-14 activity determination in water
Word count: 388
Abstract: The RadiÖko Ltd. radioanalytical laboratory and Laboratory for low-level radioactivities of the Ruđer Bošković Institute (RBI) performed an interlaboratory comparison for the determination of H-3 and C-14 activities in water samples. Three samples were measured for H-3, two for C-14 activity. Each laboratory applied their own sample preparation techniques for H-3 determination and the activities were measured by LSC Quantulus 1220. At the RBI the low H-3 activity sample A was measured by both direct and electrolytic enrichment method. For the determination of the radiocarbon activity the Zagreb laboratory used AMS technique, whilst RadiÖko used an own developed sample oxizer followed by LSC measurement using a Quantulus LSC. It is interesting to note that all three H-3 results of the RadiÖko group are lower than those obtained at RBI. The results of the two radiocarbon measurements reveal that in the case of sample D the measurement results of the laboratories lie close to each other. Sample E had too high activity to be determined by AMS technique, this way it is not possible to compare the results. In all the successfully conducted cases it is apparent that the differences are well below the 10% satisfactory range

Title: The labor supply of baby-boomers and low-flation
Word count: 3724
Abstract: Why is wage inflation so weak in spite of the recent sharp reduction in unemployment? We show that this may be due to an ongoing major positive labor supply shock. Indeed, the participation rate of workers aged between 55 and 64 has increased steadily over the last decade, from a third to above a half on average across OECD countries. This is most likely the consequence of aging and the reform of pensions. We show that the participation rate of workers aged 55 to 64 contributes to explain why wage inflation has remained weak over the last five years. For instance, it accounts for as much as -1% of wage inflation per annum in Germany since 2013. Our second result is that Phillips curves are alive and well. Wage inflation remains highly responsive to domestic unemployment rates, including after the Great Recession

basic summary: The participation rates of the elderly have a significant negative effect on wage inflation for G7 countries, in the euro area and more broadly in the OECD. We show that the participation rate of workers aged 55 to 64 contributes to explain why wage inflation has remained weak over the last five years. As shown in the first column, wage inflation is highly responsive to its three traditional determinants: lagged CPI inflation, productivity and the unemployment rate. Rate differential above 55 - below 55 P. Rate differential above 55 - below 55 dP. What is less known, at least to inflation analysts, it that it has led to a tremendous increase in the participation of older workers to the labor market2. 6 standard backward looking wage Phillips curve (in the top panel) and the one augmented with the participation rate of workers ages 55 to 64 (in the bottom panel). Ceteris paribus, this positive labor supply shock is likely to push down wage inflation and unit labor costs. A one percent drop in the unemployment rate increases wage inflation by 0.5‐0.6% on average in the G7, 0.4% for the OECD and 0.25% in the euro area.

Turning to the period after 2009, for which estimates are reported in the last column of Table  1,  2  and  3,  the  effects  of  the  unemployment  on  wage  inflation  are  still  estimated  to  be  negative.

In  columns  3  and  5 we  include  the  yearly  changes  in  the  difference  in  participation  rates  instead of their level. (2014)  note  the  shorter  time‐horizon  reduce  the  outside  value  of  the  elderly,  as  they  have  less  incentives to search for other jobs. Our  aim  is  to  assess  whether  the  increased  participation  of  older  worker  impact  wages. The  second  column  reports  the  panel  estimates  of  a  specification  augmented  with  three  additional variables:  1. the difference in the unemployment rates of two categories of workers, the ones aged  55 to 64 and the ones aged 25 to 54;  2. the rate of participation to the labor market; and,  3. the difference in the participation rates workers aged 55 to 64 and the ones aged 25  to 54.

Title: La BCE reste préoccupée par la faiblesse de l’inflation
Word count: 411
Abstract: Le Président de la Banque centrale européenne, M. Mario Draghi, a annoncé récemment que l’augmentation du taux directeur de la BCE interviendrait « bien après » la fin des mesures d’achats massifs de titres obligataires (prévue pour septembre 2018), principalement émis par les Etats de la zone euro, et à un « rythme mesuré ». La hausse du taux directeur pourrait donc intervenir vers la mi-2019, soit quelques semaines avant la passation de pouvoir entre Mario Draghi et son successeur. [Premier paragraphe

Title: Mediastinal yolk sac tumor infiltrating the heart
Word count: 2273
Abstract: Background: As a rare tumor, yolk sac tumor is a type of neoplasm that appears like the yolk sac, extraembryonic mesenchyme, and allantois. The mediastinum is the second most frequent area after the gonadal area. Case report: We present an extremely rare case of 15 years old boy with mediastinal yolk sac tumor. The boy came with the chief complaint of swelling of the neck and face. Computed tomography scan of the chest revealed bulky mass with a cystic component that infiltrated the heart. The diagnosis of mediastinal yolk sac tumor was made after core needle biopsy. Histopathologic analysis revealed tumor mass with solid and microcystic structure and pleomorphic nucleus within the tumor cells. Laboratory finding showed elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein level reaching more than 8000 ng/ml. Echocardiography revealed a mass in the right atrium. The patient condition was rapidly deteriorated due to his vena cava superior syndrome. Unfortunately, the patient died two days after diagnosis and we did not have the chance to do the therapy. Conclusion: Mediastinal yolk sac tumor is a rare malignancy that requires comprehensive management. The diagnosis should be made based on histopathological findings with the addition of thoracic computer tomography scan to assess the degree of infiltration to surrounding organ. A life-threatening condition such as vena cava superior syndrome should be assessed promptly to allow for immediate treatment

basic summary: Our patient came with superior vena cava syn- drome so we performed radiotherapy to the tumor location to release compression of the tumor to the superior vena cava. However, the prognosis of primary mediastinal yolk sac tumor is poor and further research is needed to find the best treatment modality and regi- men for the tumor. In conclusion, primary mediastinal yolk sac tumor is an aggressive tumor that often invades and infiltrates surrounding structures and metastasis.

Alpha-fetoprotein has been found in the  serum, in the cytoplasm of the tumor cells, and in the  eosinophilic globules by the immunohistochemical  techniques in yolk sac tumors [10]. Primary mediastinal  yolk sac tumor is classified as poor prognosis by the  International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group  (IGCCCG) with the 5-year survival of 50% [7]. In our  case, however, the patient presented with swelling  of his face and neck and severe respiratory distress  in the last one week that represent superior vena cava  syndrome. The radiotherapy was discontinued  despite clinical improvement because the evaluation  of the chest x-ray revealed there were no objective  signs of tumor shrinkage. If the  tumor infiltrates the wall of the heart it may produce  arrhythmias, conduction disturbances, and complete  atrioventricular blocks. Yolk sac  tumor is a malignant GCT that occurs predominantly  in male age 10 to 40 years and mostly found in gonadal  sites [8]. Yolk sac tumor can also be found  in extragonadal sites, most frequently in the anterior  mediastinum. The patient  initially responded to the radiotherapy but then his  condition declined rapidly due to his severe vena cave  superior syndrome. On the  histopathologic examination, we found tumor mass  with solid and microcystic structure. Mediastinal yolk  sac tumor producing protein induced by vitamin K absence  or antagonist-II. To our knowledge,  direct spread of mediastinal GCTs to the heart has  never been reported before so this case is the first case  such involvement has ever been reported. In this report, we present a rare case of mediastinal  yolk sac tumor in 15 years old boy that infiltrated the  heart and formed a mass in the right atrium.

Title: Presence of fire blight in apple, pear and quince in the Republic of Macedonia
Word count: 2065
Abstract: Erwinia amylovora, a bacterial blight affecting fruit, is one of the most known and dangerous diseases affecting quince, pear and apple and other Rosaceae family plants. It was first discovered in America in 1780, and first appeared in Macedonian quinces in 1989. Erwinia amylovora, called bacterial blight of fruit trees and ornamental plants, is one of the most intensely pathogenic bacteria that have been studied. It is assumed that the disease was first recognised in the United States at the end of the 18th century in wild species of plants, from which the bacteria spread to sensitive varieties of pear (Pyrus communis), apple (Malus silvestris) and quince (Cydonia oblongata), introduced by early American settlers from Eastern Europe and Southwest Asia. Drying of fruit trees was first observed in mountainous areas on both sides of the Hudson River in New York. From this region, the bacteria spread at high speed to neighbouring countries

basic summary: Erwinia amylovora, called bacterial blight of fruit trees and ornamental plants, is one of the most intensely pathogenic bacteria that have been studied. 7 Erwinia amylovora - bacterial blight of quince, pears and apples Quince (Cydonia oblonga) belongs to the genus Cydonia, subfamily Pomoidae and family Rosaceae. The bacterial blight disease is the most harmful for pears, apples, quince and other plants of the family Rosaceae. In Mexico, the disease was first reported in 1921, and in 1943 was observed in pear and apple trees (Bonn & Van der Zwet, 2000). The first is the ability of bacteria to multiply on the surface of plants without causing disease (Thomson, 2000).

text_rank summary: INTRODUCTION  Bacterial blight, caused by Erwinia amylovora, is an economically important  bacterial disease of apples and pears which is present in North America, most  countries in Western Europe, large areas around the Mediterranean Sea and New  Zealand (Bonn & Van der Zwet, 2000).Occurrence, distribution, identification and control of E. amylovora in  the region  Once the pathogen was detected in North America in the late 18th century to  early 19th century, it was identified in some states in the US as the biggest problem  for fruit production.It is  assumed that the disease was first recognised in the United States at the end of the  18th century in wild species of plants, from which the bacteria spread to sensitive  varieties of pear (Pyrus communis), apple (Malus silvestris) and quince (Cydonia  oblongata), introduced by early American settlers from Eastern Europe and  Southwest Asia.The ability for rapid expansion creates the potential for the bacteria  to be distributed over parts of Europe and North America and indicates why  eradication of the disease is rarely successful.Even in areas where climatic conditions are generally not favourable for the  development of bacterial blight epidemics, the disease may arise from time to time,  such as in the UK in the early 1980  (Gwynne, 1984).Almost 150 years after its discovery as a cause of bacterial  blight, there remain many questions about how and in what manner it causes the  disease.

INTRODUCTION  Bacterial blight, caused by Erwinia amylovora, is an economically important  bacterial disease of apples and pears which is present in North America, most  countries in Western Europe, large areas around the Mediterranean Sea and New  Zealand (Bonn & Van der Zwet, 2000). LITERATURE REVIEW  Erwinia amylovora (Burrill, 1882), the causal agent of bacterial fire blight of  fruit trees and ornamental plants, is the first bacterium that was discovered as a plant  pathogen. In Mexico, the disease was first reported in 1921, and in 1943 was observed in  pear and apple trees (Bonn & Van der Zwet, 2000). They are  distinguished according to the shape of the fruit, the shape of the crown and the  colour of the leaf, and can be divided into five groups: varieties with pear form  (variety Pyriformis), varieties with apple form (variety Maliformis), varieties with  elongated ribbed fruits and coarse sheets (Lusitanica), varieties with pyramidal  growth crowns (Pyramidalis) and varieties with variegated leaves and whitish colour  (Mormorata) (Lauffenburger, 2006.). Production of quince in the Valandovo region  Diseases that attack quince are canker, rot, brown rot, soft rot, rust, brown  spots and blight, the most important and most harmful is bacterial blight (Balaz et al.,  2013).

Title: Beginnings, conditions and perspectives of tourism in the city of Shtip
Word count: 2869
Abstract: For a scientists is a challenger to explore the beginning and the course of tourism in smaller cities.The emergence of tourism in Shtip is from a recent date. However, through the example of tourism in Shtip, we identify two historical periods: the preturism and the period of tourism.Thus, the first period lasts until the appearance of the first hotel in 1912, and the second from the middle of the twenties of the 20th century.Serious data on the tourism in Shtip are obtained from the end of the 1950's onwards.The analysis is based on primary and secondary data sources. From the analysis we learn that the tourism in Shtip in recent years has been growing with real development perspectives of diverse tourist offer and production

Title: Level Of Deepening Financial Infrastructure, Fintech\udCompanies and Financial Inclusion: Theory and\udEvidence\ud
Word count: 2886
Abstract: Financial inclusion brings the potential benefits as big part of population gain greater access to financial instruments and services. These benefits are raised up using financial tools so the need of promoting financial inclusion is more than obvious - it is global priority. Financial infrastructure can help in reducing the risks and increase the efficiency of financial markets, but can sometimes contribute to situations where excessive risks are being taken. Financial infrastructure could be considered as a system of roads under which financial intermediation takes place. Better roads reduce travel time and costs, but also increase the potential speed, which has inherent risks. These benefits are raised up using financial tools so the need of promoting financial inclusion is more than obvious, it is global priority. This paper examines that financial developments expand economic opportunity which create positive effects as theory and evidences provide sound reasons for taking this benefits

Title: Тераписки потенцијал канабиноида
Word count: 2626
Abstract: Употреба прeпарата на бази канабиса у традиционалној медицини постоји  већ више од хиљаду година и иста је документована у многим земљама широм света за лечење спастицитет мишића, конвулзија, болова, мучнине и повраћања, као и стимулације апетита. Међутим, клиничка употреба канабиноидних супстанци је ограничена због законских и етичких разлога, као и ограничених доказа о користи од њихове употребе. Од август 2016 године, пацијенти Републике Македоније имају приступ овим производима са строго контролисаним саставом и квалитетом. Ови препарати имају статут граничних производа или лекова у зависноси од концентрације THC у финалном производу. Какав је терапијски ефекат канабиноида? Има ли довољно доказа базираних на медицини заснованој на доказима за позитивне ефекте канабиноида? За које индикације имамо довољно позитивна искуства базирана на медицинским доказима? То су питања која дају одговор о тераписког потенцијала канабиноида.\u

Title: Detection of Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, bacterial stalk and heat rot disease on sunflower seeds
Word count: 832
Abstract: The important protection measurement in sunflower production is to check the quality status of the seeds, by health control. The most spread diseases on sunflower transmitted by seeds or during the season are stalk rot (Sclerotinia scletoriorum) and downy mildew (Plasmopara halstedii), which were the only quarantine pathogens observed on the fields in Macedonia. Many sunflower pathogens have never been reported in Macedonia, such as bacterial diseases. Although, the diseases can reduce yield and seed quality, they occur only intermittently and seldom are of any economic concern

Title: Assessment of the dyad mother/baby before discharge
Word count: 353
Abstract: The length of stay of healthy term newborn should be based on the unique characteristics of each mother/infant dyad, including health and stability of the mother/infant, and the confidence of the mother to care for her infant. The length of hospital stays following normal term delivery has decreased dramatically over the past few decades and early discharge is considered shorter than 48 hours after birth.  The aim of this study was to assess the dyad mother/baby before the discharge in order to reduce the risks of adverse events including neonatal readmission rates, neonatal mortality rates and emergency room visits.  Material and methods: CUSCWBEM score (acronym for color, urine, stool, color, weight, breasts and maternal emotions) was performed after obtaining informed consent from the mother. 148 pairs mother/baby from the University Clinic for Gynecology and Obstetrics in Skopje, Macedonia, were examined using CUSCWBEM score forms, containing 10 items, on the second day, while both, mother and baby were settled well.. As affirmative for discharge was a score of 8 and more points.  Results: 106 pairs mother/baby passed the assessment and considered prepared for discharge (it is 71,6%). Those who have failed the assessment mainly was for mild cyanosis (2%), jaundice (6,1%), unsatisfactory weight (2,5%), breast problems in mother (3,1%), maternal emotions, low bonding and unpreparedness (5%) and the rest had combination of two and more indicators. Those pairs were not considered for discharge in 48 hours.  Conclusion: bonding is a vital component of the attachment process as a measure for prevention of physical, emotional and social impairments through the life course. Other elements of the wellbeing are essential as well. Therefore, thorough postpartum assessment is key measure in prevention of adverse events after the early discharge, as this model was proven effective for the transition and cost-effective for the health system.  \u
